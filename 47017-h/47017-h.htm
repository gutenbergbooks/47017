<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/it.png" width="123" height="122" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE studio in Numero
&mdash; rue Boissonade had
on its holiday togs:
model stand covered
with rugs, tea table
much in evidence,
framed picture on the
easel, and lilacs
enough in the great brass bowl in the
corner to serve as sweetly affirmative
witnesses that the heart of Paris and
the heart of spring had renewed their
yearly alliance.</p>

<p>To judge from the blitheness of Carrington,
he, too, had spring in his heart
and a festal day in prospect.</p>

<p>Life, already lavish in good gifts, was
on the point of giving him the one he
most desired to grasp.</p>

<p>At twenty-one he had health, plenty
of money, and a talent to which he considered
health and money merely subservient&mdash;a
talent which lured him to
work indefatigably.</p>

<p>The portrait on which he had lavished
himself hung on the line in the spring
salon; and Velantour, the master for
whom he had toiled tirelessly for the
last three years&mdash;Velantour, the sternest
critic in France, most sparing in
praise&mdash;Velantour, whose painting expeditions
in the far East were always
solitary save for his trusted courier&mdash;<i>Velantour</i>
had invited Carrington to go
with him to the Vale of Cashmere and
the Himalayas! To paint with him and
by his side for three long, delicious
months.</p>

<p>“It is not enough to put people’s souls
on canvas, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon cher</i>, if you can’t put
nature’s heart back of them,” he had
told him, hand on his shoulder. Velantour,
whose caustic criticisms usually
confined themselves to technique, and
took small account of souls!</p>

<p>Carrington tingled to his finger tips
in the desire to be off. Life was good&mdash;was
“bully,” as Carrington phrased it.
And he whistled softly, rapturous as a
thrush, as he crossed the studio to lift a
corner of the rug which covered a trunk
masquerading as a seat, a trunk locked
and strapped; packed with an infinite
forethought for any possible contingency
that might arise during the trip;
with enough paint tubes and brushes to
set up a small dealer; packed, too, with
hopes and aspiration, which luckily take
up no room, and do not increase the excess
baggage rate. Had they weighed
the smallest fraction of an ounce apiece,
modern hydraulics could not have lifted
that trunk a single inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>“And we start to-night! Jove, it’s unbelievable!”
he said, exultantly, as he
dropped the rug corner and stood up,
straight and slender and tall, a handsome
boy with his black hair a trifle
long, his blue eyes aglow, his delicate
features alight with enthusiasm as he
drew in a long breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p>There was a touch of the romantic in
his attire&mdash;in the loosely hanging, dark
gray velveteen suit that was almost
black, and the soft cravat that had the
color of pigeon’s blood.</p>

<p>He was young enough to like that
sort of thing, dandy enough to order
those dull gray suits by the half dozen,
with long, crimson lined cloaks and
marvelous soft felt hats; and handsome
enough to make Velantour vow he
would immortalize him in them. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le
nouveau</i> Van Dyck,” he whispered to
himself, for he loved the boy as much as
he believed in his future, and he believed
in that with the intensity and concentrated
fervor of a man who permits
himself few beliefs.</p>

<p>“To have a son like that!” he would
murmur&mdash;little, squat, short-legged,
gray-headed, lonely old, famous Velantour;
and the words wrenched his lips
into the dry twist of an old grief.</p>

<p>For Velantour’s scapegrace son had
rested many years in Père-la-Chaise.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Velantour was coming this afternoon
to the informal little reunion of the half
dozen friends whom Carrington had
summoned to wish him God-speed.</p>

<p>With the warning swish of the curtains
Carrington turned to see if it was
he even now. But he saw instead a
young fellow of his own age, a youth
whose brown hair curled obstinately,
whose mouth was wide and mobile, and
who had the kind of snub nose one inevitably
associates with jollity.</p>

<p>“My dear Ned, you’re most disappointing,”
the newcomer stated, with
burlesque complaint and a gesture that
sent his hands far apart. “You ought
to be putting the last touch to a tuft of
grass in the foreground. It’s a poor
foreground that won’t stand a few extra
tufts here and there, and it’s an immensely
effective proceeding. Or else
you ought to be on your knees to the
gods. You’re neither posing piously to
please Providence, nor patently to please
Paris. I’m afraid we’ve overrated your
genius. You’ll never make a Whistler.”</p>

<p>He laughed good-humoredly as he
grasped Carrington’s outstretched hand.
Robert Parker, yclept Bobbins, took
life easily.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy, Bobbins,” Carrington
confided in him, “that I can’t even think.
Isn’t it ripping&mdash;going east with Velantour?”</p>

<p>“It is for you, Rising Genius,” Bobbins
assured him, “but so far as I am
concerned, though I might manage to
sit under a Kashmirian cedar with a fan,
standing on an icy peak with a pot of
paint strapped to my waistband, and a
fault-finding old gentleman to tell me
how badly I was using it, isn’t my ideal
of bliss. No Himalayas for me.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, Bobbins, we’re not contracting
to paint them by the yard, the
way you do a fence,” expostulated Carrington,
laughingly. “We’re going to
make pictures, not advertise breakfast
foods.”</p>

<p>“What is your sister going to do?”
queried Bobbins.</p>

<p>“Elenore is going to Brittany to-morrow
with the Waldens,” Carrington told
him promptly.</p>

<p>“And Hastings, I presume, has always
wanted to go to Brittany,” Bobbins
laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, Hastings has certainly developed
a sudden enthusiasm in that direction,”
Carrington acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Elenore&mdash;&mdash;” Bobbins
began mysteriously.</p>

<p>“I know enough to know that I don’t
know anything about girls,” Elenore’s
brother announced, promptly. “Do you
suppose Hastings&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” said Bobbins, fervently.
“And he has a bad case of it.
Wouldn’t go to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bal Bullier</i> the other
night; thinks <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafés chantants</i> are vulgar;
doesn’t hear what you are saying
half the time, and has taken to humming
‘Home-keeping hearts are happiest.’
You don’t have to take him to the hospital
to see what’s the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“I told him distinctly <i>by the hour</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
a high-pitched, patrician voice floated in
from the hall, “and if he doesn’t stop
swearing he’ll have to put his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pourboire</i>
in troches.” Coincident with the remark
a fluent outburst of Parisian profanity
came wafting in the open windows.</p>

<p>“My dear Ned,” said Mrs. Van Velt,
the owner of the patrician voice, appearing
in the doorway; “would you mind
sending some one to chloroform my
cabby? The more Carol argues with
him, the more vocal he becomes. He
seems to think that they also swear
who only sit and wait.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Velt was a dowager unmistakably
American.</p>

<p>She appeared to have been poured
into her black satin gown at some abnormally
high temperature and at a
calculation perilously close. Her gray
pompadour strained back from her high
forehead in an apparent endeavor to
oust her bonnet as an insolent trespasser
on its private domain, but the bonnet,
a black octopus with an intelligent jetty
eye, wound two narrow black velvet tentacles
firmly beneath Mrs. Van Velt’s
double chin, and triumphed calmly.</p>

<p>“You go, Bobbins,” said Carrington,
gayly. “Mrs. Van Velt, may I present
Mr. Parker? Chloroforming cabbies is
one of his specialties. You may be sure
that it will be painless and thorough.”</p>

<p>“And bring back my daughter, Mr.
Parker,” said Mrs. Van Velt, as placidly
as though she had said spectacles or
handkerchief. The obliging young
knight was already half way to the
door. “Carol thought she ought to
argue it out with him; and as she
couldn’t understand his French, and he
couldn’t understand hers, it seemed perfectly
safe.”</p>

<p>She laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice-looking boy, Ned,” she
said, as the subject of her remark disappeared.
“Who is he, and how did he
get such a remarkable name?”</p>

<p>“Bobbins?” said Carrington. “Oh,
he’s a trump. His father is the inventor&mdash;no,
his grandfather&mdash;of Parker’s
Peerless Sewing Machine. You know
all the advertisements say: ‘Observe the
bobbin. So simple, a child can work it.’
And Robert the Third is such a generous
chap, he’s an awfully easy mark.
So&mdash;Bobbins.”</p>

<p>His hands turned palms upward in
an explanatory gesture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Velt laughed again. Then
she put a hand on Carrington’s shoulder
with a touch that was almost motherly.</p>

<p>“Ned,” she said, affectionately, “I
wish your father could be here to-day to
see you before you go east. He’d be so
proud of you. How long is it since he
has seen you and Elenore?”</p>

<p>“Six years,” said Carrington. “Dear
old dad! Not since he sent us over here
in Aunt Sarah’s care, six years ago,
when mother died. He’s intended to
come every year, but there’s always been
something at the mine to prevent it.
Dad loves the struggle of business, you
know.”</p>

<p>“He loves his children, too,” said
Mrs. Van Velt, seriously. “It must be
lonely for him. And the mine is in such
a forlorn little, out-of-the-way place,
’way up there in northern Michigan.”</p>

<p>“The mines situated right in the heart
of Manhattan are pretty well worked
out,” Ned expostulated, humorously.</p>

<p>“Yellow Dog! Did you ever hear such
a ghastly name?” Mrs. Van Velt went
on. “Half the people thought your
mother was crazy when she married him
and went out there to live. They said
he was harnessing Psyche to his mine
machinery for motive power. And the
other half said that when he was tired
and wanted sympathy she’d write him a
sonnet. Everybody agreed that they
would be unhappy. And they were the
happiest people I ever knew.”</p>

<p>“They certainly were,” said Carrington,
emphatically. “How do you account
for it?”</p>

<p>“Modern prophets have a horror of
the country,” said Mrs. Van Velt, sententiously,
“unless it’s in easy motoring
distance of Sherry’s. And they overlooked
the vital fact that when you’re
making two human beings one, duplicate
good qualities are quite as useless
as duplicate wedding presents.</p>

<p>“It’s curious,” she continued, “about
you twins: that Elenore has all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
father’s love of adventure and his executive
ability, for all her girlishness; and
you have your mother’s talent and her
tastes. You couldn’t be more different,
and yet you look as much alike as you
did when you were tots. I remember
the first time your mother brought you
east. Your Uncle Dick&mdash;well, your
Uncle Dick thought rock-and-rye a
splendid tonic for other people, but
personally he took it without the rock,
which he thought might be indigestible&mdash;and
he looked at you both as you
stood there side by side. And he said:
‘Bring on your blue ribbons. I can see
two of them.’”</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Van Velt, and so early in
the day, too!” said a gay voice behind
her, a voice so like Carrington’s that it
seemed his echo; and Elenore Carrington
came forward to kiss the dowager
on both cheeks.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Van Velt had said, the resemblance
between the twins <i>was</i> remarkable.</p>

<p>They had the same height, the same
coloring, the same blue eyes that had a
trick of turning violet under emotion;
the same delicate arch to the eyebrows;
the same wavy line of hair upon the
forehead; the same buoyant poise of
body. Even a certain quick suppleness
of motion belonged to them both; and,
stranger still, their hands were wonderfully
like.</p>

<p>The artistic impulse that gave to Ned’s
a certain femininity in slenderness and
taper fingers was curiously balanced by
a strain of resourcefulness which lent to
Elenore’s well-shaped white palms so
strong a resemblance to her twin’s that
it was only by putting them side by side
and noting that hers were a bit smaller,
a shade more femininely modeled, a trifle
more delicately cushioned, that they
were distinguishable.</p>

<p>The black locks that Carrington permitted
to wave back just enough for
picturesqueness, with no trace of the
bizarre or of unkemptness, gave to his
face a boyishness that carried a suggestion
of eternal youth.</p>

<p>But Elenore’s dark hair was coiled low
in the nape of her neck, and her
manner was as feminine as was her distinctly
smart and frilly pale blue chiffon
frock.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” Elenore went on, chaffingly,
“that Aunt Sarah is safely on
her way to the North Cape and cannot
hear you describe your shocking condition.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, child,” said Mrs. Van
Velt, promptly. “You’re altogether too
good-looking. You ought to wear a
veil. That’s what young Hastings
thinks, I hear. He’s confided in Carol.
And anyone who would confide in Carol
must be laboring under strong mental
excitement. And so your Aunt Sarah
has really started for the North Cape!
Women as plain as Sarah Moore are always
pretending to be absorbed in the
beauties of nature, but they are really
trying to get their own minds and yours
away from such sensitive subjects as
snub noses.”</p>

<p>“Where is Carol?” demanded Elenore,
laughingly. “Isn’t she coming to
say good-by to Ned and me?”</p>

<p>“Carol seems to be putting in a stitch
in time with that young sewing machine,”
said Mrs. Van Velt, unperturbed.
“She’s like her father. He
never could bear to see machinery idle.”</p>

<p>Elenore looked up at her smilingly
from the place she had taken at the tea
table. The samovar was steaming gayly,
and the girl’s white hands moved with
housewifely deftness as she prepared to
make tea. They were firm, capable
hands, that it was a pleasure to watch.</p>

<p>The portières swung back with a
decided flourish to admit a short, bright-eyed,
gray-headed, animated old gentleman,
who came forward with the buoyancy
of a boy.</p>

<p>“Here I am, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cher</i> Edouard,” cried
Velantour, gayly. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mademoiselle, mes
hommages</i>, I come <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">exprès</i> to assure you
that I shall take the bes’ of care of this
brother of yours.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Van Velt,” said Carrington,
putting his hand affectionately on old
Velantour’s arm, “I present to you
Monsieur Velantour, the master of
painting in France.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Velantour, courtly
in turn, “I presen’ to you Monsieur
Edouard Carrington, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveau maître</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of whom America will one day be very
proud.</p>

<p>“You have a daughter, madame?” he
added, gravely.</p>

<p>“Somewhere,” said Mrs. Van Velt,
calmly.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est ça!</i>” said Velantour. “I fall
over two young peopl’ in the hall as I
enter&mdash;young Monsieur Parker and a
young lady&mdash;and the young lady say:
‘Oh, Monsieur Velantour, will you tell
mother I’ll be in in a minute?’ And
Monsieur Parker say: ‘So soon as she
have finish’ winding the bobbin.’”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Mrs. Van Velt,” said
Carrington, amusedly. “Bobbins is decidedly
an eligible.”</p>

<p>“What is that, an eligible?” demanded
Velantour, puzzled to know what could
justify such calm.</p>

<p>“Well, in America, Monsieur Velantour,”
Mrs. Van Velt informed him, “an
eligible is an attractive man entirely surrounded
by daughters&mdash;other people’s
daughters.”</p>

<p>“When mother begins to talk about
other people’s daughters it’s always time
for me to appear,” announced Miss
Carol Van Velt, entering gayly.</p>

<p>Bobbins, radiant, was just back of
her; and a tall, serious, thoroughbred
young fellow followed them.</p>

<p>Carol Van Velt was a remarkably
pretty blonde, who looked delightfully
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ingénue</i>, but was entirely capable of
managing most masculinity. She accepted
admiration as nonchalantly as
she did bonbons, and considered that
the sources of supply of both were unlimited.
Experience seemed to prove
that this theory was correct.</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> saw, anyway, that we were just
being used as stepping-stones to higher
things,” she went on; “so we thought
we might as well come in with Mr.
Hastings.”</p>

<p>She sank gracefully down on one end
of a large divan, and drew her skirts
aside with a gesture that assumed matter-of-factly
that Bobbins would occupy
the other half of the seat. He justified
the conclusion with a promptness which
left no doubt that he regarded it as a
heaven-sent opportunity.</p>

<p>“Not that we minded being an angels’
ladder,” he asserted, cheerfully, “but I
thought from Hastings’ cast of countenance
that he might be going to give
you a few scenes from ‘Hamlet,’ and I
didn’t think it was safe to be sitting behind
a curtain when he got to that part
about <i>Polonius</i>.”</p>

<p>Velantour regarded them with that
awe which a Frenchman must feel for
the rollicking frivolity of the American
young and the placid inefficiency
of the American parent.</p>

<p>Meantime Hastings had made his
way to Elenore and slipped into a vacant
chair by the tea table, as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>She smiled at him very charmingly.</p>

<p>“You’re late,” she said, “and you
were coming early, you know. Do you
think you deserve caravan tea with a
dash of burgundy in it?”</p>

<p>“I think I deserve all the good things
I can get to-day,” he said, and though
his tone was light, there was an undertone
that suggested that he meant it.</p>

<p>“It tastes to me more like burgundy
with a dash of caravan tea,” said Mrs.
Van Velt. “After a while they will forget
to put in the tea at all.”</p>

<p>“And then, Monsieur Velantour?”
said Carrington, amusedly; for the old
Frenchman was sipping the mixture
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Then it will not need mademoiselle’s
hands to make it perfection,” said Velantour,
with a humorous twist of his
keen old lips.</p>

<p>His gray eyes gleamed as they applauded
him laughingly. Age had intensified
in him the love of appreciation
which is innate in the Gallic heart.</p>

<p>“While we have tea, let us have
toast,” said Bobbins, promptly. “I propose
a toast to Monsieur Velantour.
Turn it into rhyme, Ned. You’re a
crack <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">improvisatore</i>.”</p>

<p>Carrington stood up, with the easy
grace of an Italian. He had the temperament
of a troubadour, and he loved
in turn a compliment.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“To Monsieur Velantour” (he began) “whose name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but a synonym for fame&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He had the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">improvisatore’s</i> trick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
lingering on the final syllable until it
brought its own suggestion.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” they applauded him; while
Velantour enjoyed the adulation with
the frankness of a child.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“So irresistible that Art” (he glanced with gay raillery at Velantour)<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Quite womanlike, has lost her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet knows it in his keeping, sure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A health to Monsieur Velantour!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>They drank it in hilarious mood.</p>

<p>Velantour was on his feet the next
instant.</p>

<p>“If I could but make one littl’ Americain
verse,” he implored, expansively.
“But I speak so poorly. You mus’ help
me a littl’.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Van Velt, practically,
“you have to begin with the street
he lives on, or something like that. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rue
Boissonade</i>&mdash;&mdash;” she began, and halted.</p>

<p>“Shall have its Claude,” suggested
Bobbins.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon!</i>” cried Velantour. “Now I
have it.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rue Boissonade</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The new <i>Van Dyck</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His <i>naïf</i> delight was contagious.</p>

<p>He patted Carrington’s arm affectionately.</p>

<p>“But we shall paint, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cher</i> Edouard!”
he said, fondly. “And you are quite
ready?”</p>

<p>“More than ready,” laughed Carrington.</p>

<p>He glanced at the little clock on the
mantel.</p>

<p>“And our train goes in just two
hours,” he whispered, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Till then,” said Velantour, gayly.
Then he crossed over to Elenore. “Mademoiselle,
I will guard your brother
as though he was&mdash;what is mos’ perishable
in English&mdash;a bubbl’, is it not?
Madame”&mdash;he bowed to Mrs. Van
Velt. “Mademoiselle”&mdash;he inclined to
Carol. “In two littl’ hours,” he called
to Carrington from the doorway, and
was gone.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the dearest thing?” Carol
demanded, frankly, of Bobbins.</p>

<p>“He’s an old brick, but not my idea
of the dearest thing,” that discriminating
individual replied, promptly. “I
don’t suppose you could guess what my
idea would be,” he insinuated.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too much of an antique,”
said Miss Van Velt, with crushing
promptness.</p>

<p>“Antique! I bought it this year,”
said Bobbins, tacking, unharmed.</p>

<p>“Then some one is selling you back
numbers,” Miss Van Velt assured him.
“Try to get your money back. It’s been
taking candy from children, and it
ought to be stopped.”</p>

<p>“The police won’t give it back,” said
Bobbins, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“The police!” said Miss Van Velt,
startled. “What have they to do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“With my Mercedes?” said Bobbins,
cheerfully. “That’s just the attitude
I’ve tried to take with them. But it has
cost me five hundred francs this week,
and this is only Wednesday. The dearest
thing on earth to me is Mercedes,
my Mercedes,” he hummed, pathetically.</p>

<p>“You naturally would lavish your
young affection on machines,” Miss
Van Velt remarked, cruelly, but she
gave him a look of decided favor.</p>

<p>“So long as you think I am in the
running,” said Bobbins, placidly.</p>

<p>The maid had brought in a letter
with an American postmark. Carrington
held it in his hand as he crossed
over to join the group around the tea
table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Velt was enjoying her
usual volubility, and Hastings was paying
her the flattery of an apparent attention
and a comprehendingly amused
smile, while his eyes gave the deeper
homage of frequent and involuntary
glances to Elenore.</p>

<p>For him, at least, Elenore was the
central figure. Nor was it only for him.
Things were quite apt to gravitate
around Elenore. Ned himself did not
overshadow his twin. If there is any
truth in theosophic theories, she had an
unusually powerful aura; if we discard
the esoteric for the exoteric, beauty and
wit and reserve force, cast in the mold
of an alluring femininity, are quite as
attractive as the same buoyant youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
plus tremendous talent, in masculine
fiber.</p>

<p>Elenore had, too, a certain firm, keen
grasp on the realities of life which Carrington,
with all his localized talent,
lacked. One felt that she would not
fail in any qualm, that she would not be
daunted by any obstacle, that in crises
she would think not of surrender or
sacrifice, but of resource and expedient.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Velt was concluding her
story of a recent tea given for a famous
woman novelist.</p>

<p>“<i>Did</i> she talk about her work?” she
exclaimed. “She never got away from
her books, and she drenched us with
her successes until our ardor was more
than dampened. It was soaked. She
gave us to understand that she had
Browning beaten on obscurity, Ibsen on
subtlety, and Maeterlinck on imagination.
And when she left there was a
heavy silence for a minute, and then
Alec Carter said: ‘Now let’s talk nursery
rhymes for a while. We might
begin on “Little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bas bleu</i>, come blow
your horn.”’”</p>

<p>She made her adieux on the strength
of that, collecting her purse, her feather
boa and her daughter from different
parts of the room, with surprising
promptitude.</p>

<p>It was her practice to save her best
rocket for the last, and disappear in
the glory of its swish.</p>

<p>Bobbins accompanied the Van Velts
to their carriage, and, to misquote long-suffering
Omar, once departed, he returned
no more.</p>

<p>Carrington turned to Hastings the
moment they were out of the door.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse me if I read dad’s letter,
won’t you? My time is getting so
short,” he said, apologetically; and went
over to one of the long windows to get
the benefit of its light.</p>

<p>Elenore turned to Hastings with the
question that had been hovering on her
lips for the last half-hour.</p>

<p>“Tell me why you are so serious,”
she said. “Has anything gone wrong?
It doesn’t mean that you are not coming
to Brittany to see the Waldens and&mdash;me&mdash;this
summer, does it?”</p>

<p>“It means a great deal more than
that,” said Hastings, soberly. “Yesterday
I thought I was on my way to being
a rising architect. To-day I am simply
cast into outer darkness. The shears
of fate have clipped this piece of my
life short, and I can’t see what the next
is going to be like.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Elenore, quietly.</p>

<p>“It’s grotesquely simple,” said Hastings,
and there was an involuntary tinge
of bitterness in the tone he tried to keep
even. “My uncle, who has given me my
start in life&mdash;the only relative I have&mdash;has
written me to come back to New
York at once. I’m to give up being an
architect. When it’s the only thing I
am fitted for! He has something else
for me. He doesn’t explain what. He
does vouchsafe the information that the
place is quite impossible, but, he says,
what are a few years out of a young
man’s life?” His voice was a trifle unsteady.
Years seemed eternity to him
just then.</p>

<p>“I must go, of course, unquestioningly,”
he went on, holding himself in
check. “Considering that I owe him
everything, it’s a military command.
And I have no right to say anything
but good-by to&mdash;to any woman. I’m
out of things, that’s all.”</p>

<p>So much, at least, he vowed he would
tell her; but he was determined that he
would not be so weak as to ask her to
wait for him.</p>

<p>The years of his uncle’s bounty fettered
him hopelessly. When he knew
where he stood, when he had something
definite to offer her, then&mdash;but
not till then. But it was bitter. He
had supposed, of course, that he would
go back in the autumn, open an office,
be self-supporting, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It was a few seconds before Elenore
spoke. When she did her voice was
cheerful and friendly.</p>

<p>“There is always something interesting
in the most impossible places,” she
said. “It may be rather fun. And we
shall expect you to make it as picturesque
as possible in your letters, if we
tell you all the gossip here in exchange.”</p>

<p>He said to himself that she understood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
at least. He thanked Heaven for
that, as youth is prone to thank Heaven
when Heaven lives up to its expectations.
And if the place was not so very
impossible&mdash;<i>if</i>&mdash;and <i>perhaps</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So hope began to whisper. And then
because If and Perhaps were all he
could take with him, because she was
so winsome and dear and so desirably
human, because she was so daintily
proud, and because the things he was
not to tell her refused to be held back,
he caught her hands in his, whispered:
“God bless you! I shall write you everything&mdash;that
I can,” and, wrapping
his New England conscience round him,
went without a backward glance.</p>

<p>Elenore stood quite still for a moment.
The shadows were beginning to
thicken in the long room, and she felt a
certain restfulness in the half-light.</p>

<p>Then she turned resolutely toward
her brother. Something in the dejection
of his poise quickened her instantly.</p>

<p>“Ned! What is it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“It’s the deluge&mdash;without an ark,”
said Carrington, without stirring.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Elenore, tersely.</p>

<p>“I’m not going east with Velantour.
I’m going home,” he said, mechanically.</p>

<p>“Not dad?” she said, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No.” He answered the unfinished
question. “But he’s broken his leg, poor
old dad! And other things are wrong,
and he wants me.”</p>

<p>“And me?” she questioned, quickly.
“Doesn’t he want me?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Carrington, impatiently.
“He wants his son, he says, and he shall
have me. And he shan’t know I ever
whimpered about coming. I’m not cad
enough for that. But going east with
Velantour <i>is</i> the chance of a lifetime,
and it takes a minute or two to get
heroic about giving it up, that’s all. All
except that it’s bitter to think how little
use I shall be to him when I get there,
for it’s partly business, and I haven’t a
particle of business ability. That will
be <i>his</i> disappointment, which is bitterer
still.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that he doesn’t
want me?” Elenore demanded. “Where
is the letter?”</p>

<p>Carrington held it out to her without
a word.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dear Ned (it read), I’m sorry to call
you home, but I must. I’m laid up with
a broken leg&mdash;compound fracture. Don’t be
alarmed. I’m in no danger of dying. But
there are business complications I want to
talk over with you&mdash;things it’s only fair to
you to let you help decide. It may be only
for a few weeks. Then you can go back.
Let Elenore stay in Paris. It’s all man’s
work to be done here. Just responsibilities
to be met.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l5">Your father,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">John Carrington</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Ned Carrington was turning over the
pages of the morning <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>“I can catch the train for London in
an hour, and sail from Liverpool tomorrow,
or&mdash;no, here it is&mdash;I can leave
here in the morning and get a boat at
Boulogne. That will be better,” he
planned.</p>

<p>“And Velantour?” Elenore questioned.</p>

<p>He threw out his hands despairingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive to the station and tell him,”
he said. “Then I’ll come back and unpack&mdash;and
pack.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I go to dad instead of
you?” Elenore demanded.</p>

<p>“Because it’s man’s work to be
done,” said Carrington, impatiently.
“Don’t argue it. I wish I had your
brains for it, though. But it’s me that
dad wants, and what he wants he shall
have.”</p>

<p>“Two people are going to America
who don’t want to go in the least. But
they are men, and so, presumably, useful,”
she said, spiritedly. “And the one
person who would really like to go
can’t; because she is a woman, and so,
presumably, useless.” She flung her
head backward a bit impatiently as
she looked at her twin. He was fumbling
among the papers on his desk;
and the long mirror above it showed
his face flushed and perturbed and boyish.
Then she caught sight of her own
in the glass, and started.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a pen here,” Ned said,
irritably. “I must send dad a cable.”</p>

<p>“There’s one in my room,” she said,
and her tone was full of energy and
spirit. “Get it, while I tell Berthe to
run for a cab, and you can take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
message to the office on your way to
tell Velantour.”</p>

<p>Her hand was on the bell as he disappeared.
She had snatched up paper
and pencil the next second, and was
dashing off a note.</p>

<p>“Berthe,” she said, as the little maid
hurried in, “you are to go for a cab,
and see that it gets here in just fifteen
minutes precisely; not before, mind.
Tell the <i>cocher</i> that he shall have five
francs <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pourboire</i> if he is exact.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bien</i>, mademoiselle,” said the little
maid.</p>

<p>“Post this note to Mrs. Walden, and
come back with a second cab in twenty-five
minutes, without fail. Either my
brother or myself will give you your
last instructions for the summer.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bien</i>, mademoiselle,” said the little
maid&mdash;as she would have said it to any
command short of murder.</p>

<p>She sped out, pleasingly stimulated
by the silver coin in her palm.</p>

<p>“Has she gone?” demanded Ned, feverishly,
as he reappeared with the pen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elenore. “Write your
message and read it off to me when
you’ve done it, will you? I want to
tuck some things into the bag that’s
going to America.”</p>

<p>She nodded, smilingly, as she sped
into his room.</p>

<p>Carrington sat down with a stifled
groan. The sweetness had gone out of
life. It was duty now. Say what you
will, six years’ absence loosens ties of
blood; and though he was ashamed to
confess it himself, it was with a lagging
loyalty that he thought of going home.</p>

<p>His whole life had been bent in one
direction, and this abrupt break demanded
a heroism which he resolved to
simulate, at least. But he need not begin
yet.</p>

<p>He could make his little moan to
himself for this instant when he was
alone.</p>

<p>He dipped the pen in the ink.</p>

<p>The first sheet of paper blotted hopelessly.
And the second. The fingers
that held a brush with unfaltering and
delicate touch were clumsily nervous
now.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>John Carrington, Yellow Dog, Mich, (he
got down). Am coming first boat.</p></blockquote>

<p>“What was the boat?” he demanded
of himself, and helplessly turned back
to the <i>Herald</i> for information.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Kaiser Wilhelm</i> sailing Cherbourg tomorrow.</p>

<p class="p0 in14">
<span class="smcap">Ned.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then he dropped his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>The written words seemed to make
the thing so irrevocable.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together and
walked nervously over to the window.
Where on earth <i>was</i> the cab? It was a
comfort to vent irritability on something.</p>

<p>Then he roved over to the trunk he
had packed with such forethought.</p>

<p>He laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“Poor old Velantour! He will be
disappointed, too,” he whispered. “But
of the two old men who love me, one
has to go to the wall. And it shan’t be
dad.”</p>

<p>He tramped up and down restlessly
until he heard the sound of wheels.</p>

<p>Then he called to Elenore.</p>

<p>“I am going now.”</p>

<p>“Not in this cab, you are not,” her
voice answered him. “This is mine.
Yours will be here in ten minutes, and
you will have lots of time then.”</p>

<p>“What?” he called, halfway to the
door, and not believing his ears.</p>

<p>The door swung open, and in it he
saw&mdash;himself.</p>

<p>Clad in loosely hanging dull gray
velveteens, with a soft cravat the color
of pigeon blood. Over his arm a long
crimson-lined cape hung, half-concealing
a suit case. The face, which was
his, laughed at him triumphantly, and
shook its dark hair, worn a trifle long,
back from the forehead.</p>

<p>In the disencumbered hand a soft felt
hat waved him back with a dash of bravado.</p>

<p>“Tell Berthe what you please when
she comes with your cab,” his own
voice cried gayly. “I’ve just time to
catch the London train. You are for
the east, I believe.” Then, as he stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
thunderstruck, his double laughed exultantly.</p>

<p>“There’s a letter, with copious details,
on your dresser,” the apparition
stated, with a lilt of pure joy of escapade.
“Considering the shortness of
the time, I think I’ve been marvelous in
thinking out all possible exigencies.”</p>

<p>And to his gesture of protest, of incredulity:
“Don’t argue! You are to
live the life you care for, for your
three wonderful months, and so shall I.
It’s not sacrifice. It’s selfishness. I
want to go desperately. And I’ll write
you here&mdash;volumes. You’ll find them
when you get back.”</p>

<p>Then that voice which was his, and
was not his, chanted saucily:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Rue Boissonade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall have its Claude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And l’Amerique<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new Van Dyck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Carrington<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall have his son.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The doorway was empty. He heard
a <i>cocher</i> crack his whip, and a cab-horse
evidently making record time. Five
francs, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon Dieu, ça vaut la peine</i>!</p>

<p>Ned Carrington stood bewildered.
What should he do? He might follow
her&mdash;might make a scene&mdash;but he was
always worsted when Elenore became
daintily willful. She was quite capable
of carrying it off, too. And it <i>was</i> a
lark!</p>

<p>A cab came clattering up the little
street. The call of the East came to
him with an overpowering lure. A
wave of joy swept over him that he
<i>could</i> go, after all. He felt a fury of
impatience to be off. He grudged the
time to give Berthe her instructions, to
snatch Elenore’s letter from the dresser,
to catch up his hat and coat. The mere
thought to do these things should be
enough. But Berthe’s willing feet were
speeding up the stairway. He flung the
rug from his more-than-ready trunk,
and laughed as he touched the strap caressingly
with his fingers.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” he whispered; and the
words sung themselves to the rhythm
of rapture unalloyed.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Et puis, m’sieu?</i>” said Berthe,
breathlessly, from the doorway.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>The case of the old-fashioned watch
snapped together for the fortieth time
in John Carrington’s restless hands, and
he sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>Not since those days of dread loneliness
after his wife’s death, when he
had first sent the children abroad, had
time dragged so rackingly.</p>

<p>His leonine, iron-gray head moved irritably
among the pillows of the bed
where he had been “caged,” as he called
it, for three interminable weeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley, tidying up the room
with an accentuation of her usual briskness,
gave him as indulgent a look as
the formation of her rigid cast of countenance
would permit.</p>

<p>“Wearin’ out your watch case won’t
hurry up that train none,” she observed,
as she straightened a china cat on the
mantel into an expectant attitude.</p>

<p>It had been her gift the previous
Christmas to John Carrington, and her
admiration of it extended to the hope
that it would pleasingly impress the returning
traveler.</p>

<p>“Miss Elenore was fondest of animals,
though,” she murmured, absently.</p>

<p>John Carrington’s eyes twinkled appreciatively.
He did not share Mrs.
Kipley’s admiration for her feline gift.</p>

<p>“Ned will appreciate that cat, though,
Mrs. Kipley,” he said, genially. “You
know he’s been studying <i>art</i>;” but with
the word a shadow came over his face.</p>

<p>“It’s hard on the lad, bringing him
back,” he said. “Yellow Dog will look
pretty crude to him, I expect.”</p>

<p>He moved his head restlessly, and the
leg in its swinging splint became more
exasperatingly painful.</p>

<p>Of course it would be only natural
for Ned to have grown away from
home ties. It was an unspoken thought
against which he had braced himself
for all these ten days. If the boy came
back half-heartedly, contemptuous of
the place, indifferent to the mine, alienated
from his father&mdash;that was the
touch of the thumbscrew.</p>

<p>And yet, he told himself wearily, six
years was a long time. The boy was talented,
cultured, used to all the refinements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of an older civilization. What
wonder if&mdash;&mdash; And if he, through love
for his son, and carrying out his mother’s
wishes for his future, had been responsible
for the separation which
might mean all this?</p>

<p>Ah, well, he was not the first father,
nor the last, to think out these same
things, and try to see them dispassionately.</p>

<p>“He was real spry about starting,”
said Mrs. Kipley.</p>

<p>John Carrington’s face relaxed.</p>

<p>“Caught the first boat,” he said.
Then “Is his room ready and comfortable?”
he demanded, as he had demanded
many times.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about that room
none, if I was you,” said Mrs. Kipley,
serenely.</p>

<p>“Did you remember about the cigars
and a decanter of whisky?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley looked at him in a patient
exasperation.</p>

<p>“They’s two kinds of cigars, every
brand of cigarettes Kipley could lay
hands on in Yellow Dog, the biggest
decanter full of whisky, the motto ‘Love
One Another,’ that my Sunday-school
class worked for me last winter; red-white-and-blue
soap in the soap dish,
and two pincushions with a French
motto worked on each of ’em. Hemmy
did ’em in black and white pins. She
thought’t would make it seem more like
Paris to him. One says ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive Napoleon</i>,’
and the other says ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Veuve Cliquot</i>.’
Kind of twins, you see.”</p>

<p>John Carrington’s mouth twitched.
Then he frowned slightly. For would
the boy understand? If he were not
amused&mdash;if he were merely contemptuous!</p>

<p>“Hemmy’s picking some flowers for
the house now,” Mrs. Kipley went on,
serenely. “And Kipley’s took a saddle
horse besides the road wagon, so’s if
Mr. Ned wanted to ride over, he could.”</p>

<p>The case of John Carrington’s watch
came open once more. If the train was
on time, and Ned did choose the saddle
horse, another ten minutes&mdash;&mdash; But
would he? The lad was a bit of a
dandy. Carrington had smiled indulgently
over some of his tailor’s bills.
Probably you couldn’t coax him on a
horse, even in Yellow Dog, unless he
was arrayed in all the proper paraphernalia.</p>

<p>But what was that clatter of horse’s
hoofs&mdash;fast and furious&mdash;faster and
more furious than any Yellow Dog had
heard since the day three weeks ago
when the Carrington team, terrorized
by a small boy’s premature bunch of
firecrackers, had run away, and John
Carrington, thrown from the wreckage
of his light buggy, had been brought
home with a badly fractured leg?</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley looked out of the window.</p>

<p>“Merciful sakes!” she ejaculated,
startled.</p>

<p>Not an accident to Ned, John Carrington
prayed, with stiff, dry lips and
apprehensive eyes.</p>

<p>“Of all things!” Mrs. Kipley murmured;
and her tone indicated that she
was now past surprise, and merely
numbered with the numb.</p>

<p>Some one was running up the veranda
steps; the door was flung open,
and a tall, dark, slender boy in a marvelous
suit of dull gray velveteens stood
on the threshold.</p>

<p>A long, crimson-lined cape was flung
over his arm. He tossed it from him.
And “Dad!” he cried, exultantly, and
was across the room, with his arms
around his father’s neck, and had
kissed him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>“French fashion, dad!” he laughed,
flushing suddenly.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll do it the Anglo-Saxon
way;” and he caught both his father’s
hands in his own and wrung them
heartily. “It’s great to be home again,”
he said, buoyantly.</p>

<p>And the joyful light in his eyes was
unmistakably genuine.</p>

<p>John Carrington’s face softened
amazingly. Happiness such as he had not
known for six years gripped him. The
warm ardor of his son’s embrace, the
touch of the soft, boyish lips, unnerved
him, but he liked it astonishingly. It
was so naïf, so unspoiled, so reassuring
against that dread of alienation he had
endured, that he felt submerged in the
warm, comfortable certitude of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
son’s affection. He gripped the lad’s
hands strongly, and surveyed him with
a proud, fatherly interest.</p>

<p>The blue eyes that looked frankly
into his own were like the lad’s mother’s,
like Althea’s; the face that smiled
gayly at him was alight with youthful
energy, and the mouth, though the lips
were a trifle full, had firm and resolute
lines.</p>

<p>It was no dawdling dreamer that he
saw, but an action-lover.</p>

<p>He nodded satisfiedly.</p>

<p>“You’ll do, lad,” he said, briefly.</p>

<p>Then he smiled as he caught sight of
Mrs. Kipley, standing with the rigidity
of an automaton, dust cloth in hand.</p>

<p>“You remember Mrs. Kipley,” he
said, significantly. The boy wheeled instantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t I!” he said, laughingly, and
something in his advance galvanized
Mrs. Kipley into life again.</p>

<p>“None of your French fashions with
me,” she said, severely, extending her
right hand to him, less in greeting than
as a rampart.</p>

<p>He swept a wonderful bow over it.
Bent to it as a courtier might have done,
and kissed its wrinkled, work-hardened
back lightly. Then he straightened up
to look her full in the eyes, and laughed
his bubbling laugh once more.</p>

<p>“Do you still make those wonderful
twisted doughnuts, Mrs. Kipley?” he
asked, gayly. “I’ve bragged about them
in Paris till they’re famous.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley was scrutinizing the
back of her hand minutely, to see if it
was still intact. Finding it apparently
uninjured, she drew breath and looked
the surprising apparition in the face.
Her own relaxed to his handsome, dashing
youth and to his praise.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re about the same,” she
said, dryly. But John Carrington
chuckled to himself. He recognized the
subjugation of Mrs. Kipley.</p>

<p>“What will he be with the young
women!” he commented, to himself,
amusedly.</p>

<p>Then he asked the question that was
consuming Mrs. Kipley:</p>

<p>“Ned, are those clothes the <i>style</i> in
Paris?”</p>

<p>The boy swung himself lightly into
the big armchair beside the bed.</p>

<p>“They’re the badge of my craft, sir,”
he said, good-humoredly, settling the
soft cravat with deft fingers. “Don’t
you like them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>I</i> like them,” said John Carrington.
(“Handsome lad!” he was whispering
to himself, proudly.) “But I
was wondering how they would strike
Yellow Dog, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“There did seem to be some little interest
in my arrival,” the lad admitted,
gleefully.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! They beat anything I
ever see in all my life!” Mrs. Kipley
communed with herself.</p>

<p>“And Elenore?” said John Carrington.
“How did you leave Elenore?”</p>

<p>The boy stirred slightly in his chair.</p>

<p>“Elenore is well, dad. She wanted to
come. I think she was a little disappointed
that you didn’t want your
daughter instead of your son.”</p>

<p>John Carrington shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yellow Dog is no place for a young
lady, Ned,” he said. “It was better for
her to stay with her friends. I should
have liked to see her, though. She’s
quite a woman, from her picture. Time
for sweethearts, eh? Your Aunt Sarah
wrote a good deal about a young Hastings.
She seemed to think it might
be serious.”</p>

<p>The boy flushed annoyedly.</p>

<p>“Aunt Sarah loves to fuss and exaggerate,”
he said, and there was a slight
coolness in his voice. “Maiden aunts
are apt to, you know,” he went on, more
naturally. He smiled his attractive
smile once more. Whatever had perturbed
him for the instant was past.</p>

<p>Miss Hematite Kipley, <i>ætat</i> seventeen,
coming into the room with a fragrant
bowl of syringa blossoms, compared
it favorably with any picture her
beloved romancers had been able to
conjure up.</p>

<p>From the moment when she had seen
the picturesque figure dismount and
make a rapid way into the house, she
had been perishing to make this entrance,
but she had restrained herself
in accordance with her ideas of propriety
and gentility. Miss Kipley strove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to be “elegant,” aided by certain open
columns in respected periodicals, after
which she patterned her conduct and
her clothes.</p>

<p>The meeting between father and son
she characterized as “a sacred moment,”
and she regretted her mother’s continued
intrusion upon it with the resigned
exasperation of one who had often and
fruitlessly pointed out to a primitive
parent the proper forms of procedure.</p>

<p>Miss Kipley was rather pretty in a
wholesome, buxom, blond way, and
the “open columns” had stimulated her
to a crisp freshness of attire, and partially
reconciled her to the maternal
regulations of its enforced simplicity.</p>

<p>She came into the room with her
eyelids so demurely lowered that she
might have been taken for a sleepwalker.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Hemmy,” said John
Carrington, with an outward courtesy
which marked an inward amusement.
In spite of her physical bulk, Miss Hematite
was mentally transparent.</p>

<p>“Why, <i>Hemmy</i>!” said young Carrington,
gayly, “how awfully pretty you
have grown!”</p>

<p>Miss Kipley felt an inward commotion
which threatened suffocation. Her
fingers tightened on the blue bowl in a
way which tested its enduring qualities.
Mrs. Kipley’s maternal eye became vigilant.</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of a wrinkle
on John Carrington’s brow. He hoped
the boy would remember that this was
not Paris; that the Kipleys represented
the survival of a good many New England
traits.</p>

<p>But neither parent could find anything
to criticise in the way the lad relieved
the blushing Hemmy of the bowl,
shook her hand in a cordial, unaffected
way, and turned to set the white blossoms
on the square ledge of the open
window, where the breeze converted
them into a spicy censer.</p>

<p>As for Hematite, though visibly she
stood in a deep pink embarrassment, in
fancy she trod the sunny slopes of romance.
This was the way things happened
in the books over which she
pored, palpitant. She sought vainly for
some appropriate expression of welcome.</p>

<p>“I guess Hemmy and me will let you
have a chance to get acquainted. I
can finish dusting by and by,” said Mrs.
Kipley, tersely. “Your old room’s all
ready for you, Mr. Ned. Come, Hemmy.”</p>

<p>That young person followed her
mother mechanically from the room.</p>

<p>“Cat got your tongue?” inquired Mrs.
Kipley, severely, in the hall. “For all
you are forever reading about the proper
way to do things, you can’t even say
‘Glad to see you back.’”</p>

<p>Miss Kipley looked down from the
happy heights to which she had mentally
withdrawn herself, to the prosaic
parent treading the valley of plain realities.</p>

<p>“There are moments beyond words,”
she vouchsafed. Then she sped down
the garden path to the now sacred syringa.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley watched her from the
doorway with an anxious air.</p>

<p>“I hope she ain’t caught anything,”
she murmured. “That was a terrible
fool remark. I don’t know what there
is around just now for her <i>to</i> catch.”</p>

<p>But it is characteristic of the disorder
which Miss Hematite had so recently
acquired that no one save the person
afflicted knows it’s around till the case
has taken.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The lad had slipped his fingers in
his father’s, and they sat a little while
in silence. So Althea and John Carrington
had often sat, in that silent
communion which is the bond of the
finest fellowship.</p>

<p>Mr. Abner Kipley, entering suddenly,
with Ned’s suit case in hand and a
desire to expatiate on recent events
oozing from every pore, viewed this singular
proceeding as one further extraordinary
manifestation emanating from
the same remarkable cause.</p>

<p>“Seems you <i>can</i> teach an old dog
new tricks,” he communed with himself.
“Probably by to-morrow I’ll be
holding hands myself.” He chuckled
grimly to himself over the impossible
thought. But the glance he gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
lad from under his shaggy eyebrows
was unwillingly admiring.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Kipley prided himself on
his unerring attitude of judicial criticism.</p>

<p>The boy swung round in his chair to
greet him smilingly.</p>

<p>“You walked over, Mr. Kipley, I assume,”
he said, mischievously.</p>

<p>“I didn’t try to kill a horse ’n’ get
my neck broke,” responded Mr. Kipley,
defensively.</p>

<p>“You picked up thet baby nice,
though,” he added, with the air of a
man willing to be just.</p>

<p>John Carrington looked at him with
an air of sudden inquiry.</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> lucky,” said the lad, languidly;
and he lounged over to the
open window, as though the subject
was finished.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to,” said Mr. Kipley, impatiently,
to the growing insistence of
John Carrington’s look.</p>

<p>He objected to being hurried in the
narration of a story which he rejoiced
was his to tell.</p>

<p>“When he,” he began, jerking his
head in the lad’s direction, “’lected to
ride the Colonel home, he threw that
red-backed garmint”&mdash;no mere black-and-white
could reproduce the patronage
of Mr. Kipley’s tone&mdash;“’cross the
saddle in front of him. ’N’ the Colonel,
not being used to the fashions in Paris,
bolted. They went up the road’s though
they was goin’ to glory, ’n’ didn’t have
but one chance to ketch the limited.
’N’ <i>I</i> threw his grip in the wagon ’n’
started after ’em.</p>

<p>“It was good ridin’,” said Mr. Kipley,
approvingly, “’n’ everybody thet could
turned out to see it. It was interestin’
and free.</p>

<p>“Thet curve by Trevanion’s cottage
is a mean place,” Mr. Kipley continued,
reflectively. “I’ve run the team into
several things there myself, includin’ a
dog fight, which c’ncluded about the
time we run over the principal fighter’s
tail.” He switched himself back on
the main track. “Thet baby of Trevanion’s
was tryin’ to ketch a hen just as
the exhibition come along.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said John Carrington, and
his voice whistled like a pistol shot.</p>

<p>“Down with his arm, ’n’ half out of
the saddle&mdash;grab&mdash;’n’ yank up&mdash;’n’
’bout face&mdash;hand the baby to a long-legged
girl&mdash;’n’ off he goes, leaving me
to destroy my c’nstitution, breathin’
dust all the way home. Thet’s your
son’s idea of gettin’ here,” he concluded,
dryly.</p>

<p>John Carrington drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“If anything had happened to that
baby, we should have had the devil’s
own time,” he said. “Trevanion has
been sullen ugly ever since his wife
died&mdash;took his trouble that way&mdash;and
the baby is the only thing in the world
he cares for. If&mdash;well, we might have
lost the best shift boss in the country.”</p>

<p>Young Carrington stood very still,
looking out of the window. If the incident
had shaken him a bit, there was
at least no outward sign of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley drew nearer to the bed.</p>

<p>“There’s good stuff in him,” he said,
semi-confidentially, as though recent
residence in a foreign land unfitted one
to hear undertone, “’n’ grit. But, for
the sake of Moses, get those clo’s offen
him.”</p>

<p>Upon which advice, he retired hastily
from the room.</p>

<p>John Carrington looked across the
room at his son with a smile that was
at once quizzical and affectionate.</p>

<p>“Yellow Dog finds you a trifle too
picturesque, boy,” he said, and his tone
suggested that he at any rate was satisfied.
“How about you? Pretty big
trial to come back?”</p>

<p>“I should have come, whether you
sent for me or not, when I knew you
were hurt,” said the boy, and there was
a defiant little ring in his voice. “Where
should I be, or want to be, but at home
and with you?”</p>

<p>John Carrington’s heart beat proudly.
This was the kind of son to have. He
said “home” as though he meant it. He
was loyal. Now he, John Carrington,
had an heir to show to some <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I needed you,” he said, quietly. “Not
on account of this confounded leg;
though it’s been hard to be shut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
for the first time in my life&mdash;hung up
to mend, like a china plate. But it
made me think I was just mortal, after
all. And of your future and Elenore’s.
And it’s only fair to you to let you decide
how you’d rather have things.”</p>

<p>The look the boy gave him now was
a quiet, concentrated attention.</p>

<p>“Without going into details about
our mine, that no one but a mining man
could understand,” Carrington went on,
with a restful security engendered by
that look, “I want to tell you the
straight facts. It’s characteristic of this
region that in sinking every now and
then you strike a big hole filled with
water&mdash;a vug, they call it. Now, we
can take care of what we strike ourselves,
but the Tray-Spot, which is
newer and shallower, is letting us take
care of theirs. Instead of pumping it
up, they let the water seep through to
the Star, and <i>we</i> lift it. It cuts off profits,
and makes our mine dangerous.
The two mines ought to be under the
same management, anyway. Expenses
could be cut almost in two. So I wrote
the owner of the Tray-Spot&mdash;an Easterner&mdash;never
comes out here&mdash;to ask
him what he’d sell for. Richards, the superintendent,
is a good deal of a scoundrel,
and responsible for all the trouble.
Of course mining is just a business
proposition to those Easterners. They
haven’t fought things out here in the
early days, as some of us have. And
this man had never even been on the
ground. Bought the mine from Riley
when he went to smash. And he’s childless.
No second generation to take it
up.</p>

<p>“That’s practically what I wrote
him,” Carrington went on, doggedly,
“and why it should have struck him
just wrong, and turned him pig-head
and ugly is beyond me. But he wrote
back that if he had never been here, he
wasn’t too old to come now. And that
if he didn’t have a son, he had a
nephew, who was a first-class business
man and smart as a steel trap, whom
he proposed to bring out here, and to
keep on the ground. And that, as he
understood from his superintendent
that the one son <i>I</i> had was spending his
time in Paris studying art, the mines
would be better off with his heir than
mine. And would I put a selling price
on the Star? The Star, that I’ve put
my lifeblood into! And that letter”&mdash;there
was the rage of a wounded lion
now&mdash;“was the first thing they read me
after I came out from the ether to find
myself tied up like&mdash;like this&mdash;&mdash;” he
finished, at a loss for any adequate comparison.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to fight or to sell,” he
finished, “and if anything happened to
me, what would you children know
about disposing of it? That’s what I’ve
thought as I’ve lain here. Hadn’t I better
leave things safe for you, if I do
have to kill time for a few years myself?”</p>

<p>His eyes looked worn. How many
times he had gone over it! How many
times affection for his children had
warred against his pride in the mine he
had discovered, developed, managed,
owned! It all seemed a part of long,
restless nights, of narcotics and anodynes
that brought nightmares as often
as oblivion; nights in which the young
mine doctor seemed mixed up with the
obstinate Easterner who owned the
Tray-Spot, and the pain throbs and the
pumping apparatus at the mine seemed
to have some curious relationship.</p>

<p>“Sell! Never!” the fresh young
voice flung back instantly, and the timbre
of it was a battle-cry. “We’ll fight,
dad&mdash;for our rights first, and then&mdash;then
we’ll buy!”</p>

<p>He stood erect, every curve of fine
youthfulness buoyant with victories to
come, his head flung a trifle back and
his mouth resolute.</p>

<p>Fatherly pride, exultation, triumph,
swung John Carrington up on his elbow
from his pillows in a certain fierce
joy, and something glistened on his
cheek&mdash;something that pain and fatigue
and loneliness had never crystaled there.</p>

<p>“I have a son to stand by me,” he
said, and it was the dignity of a king
to the crown prince.</p>

<p>The leonine old head was lifted
proudly, and the hand that he stretched
out might have held a scepter.</p>

<p>Then reaction of the strain came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
swiftly, and the lad leaped to him, as
he dropped back limp and white against
the pillows, with a sudden film drawn
over the eyes so lately keen of sight, and
the rushing of many waters in the ears
that had heard so happily.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Yellow Dog was having the time of
its life.</p>

<p>It was, to use a local idiom, passing
out a new line of talk every day.</p>

<p>What this sudden access of interest
meant to an isolated small town which
existed solely on account of its two
mines one would have to live in Yellow
Dog to understand.</p>

<p>The Tray-Spot and the Star were at
opposite ends of the town’s main street,
each a local fetish in its way to the
miners.</p>

<p>Underfoot everywhere the soft red
hematite ore stained everything that it
touched.</p>

<p>Beyond, hills after hills covered with
scraggy pine. Half a mile to the south
was the railway station, and a spur ran
to both mines.</p>

<p>Since the loungers around that station
had witnessed the home-coming of
young Carrington, conversation had
flourished in dialects Cornish and Irish
and Swedish and “Dago,” as well as
that tongue to which its users alluded
proudly as “United States.”</p>

<p>The first comment of all this polyglot
assemblage had inclined toward the
critical, with emphasis which ran the
gamut from the humorous to the snarl,
laid on what Mr. Kipley had characterized
as “those dum clothes.”</p>

<p>Trevanion, shift boss, coming to the
surface that first night, to learn of the
child’s peril, heard it in silence and
with smoldering eyes; heard it sullenly
as he held the child in his arms, and
with a surly nod went back to his cottage.</p>

<p>And the long-legged girl who told
him resented his silence as a lack of interest
not only in the event, but in her
narrative.</p>

<p>It was not often that anything so exciting
happened. Events were usually
underground casualties in Yellow Dog.
“’E could ’a’ said ’e was glad the child
wasna killed,” she complained to her
father.</p>

<p>“’E’d na say what you maun know,
onyway,” she got for comfort; for the
men admired Trevanion, and trusted
him blindly.</p>

<p>They comprehended, too, the way he
had taken his trouble, and they left him
to himself, since he wished it. It was
his way; just as it was his way to read,
to study, to get some beginnings of the
patiently dug-out education of a dully
persistent man.</p>

<p>If he had lost his Cornish accent,
save in excitement or in his orders to
them, he had not lost his Cornish patience,
nor that curious Cornish affinity
between man and mine.</p>

<p>What they did not understand was
the measure of his fierce love for his
child; the child that was to have a
chance. This was the mainspring of
his life.</p>

<p>Trevanion was seated on his doorstep,
with the child on his knee, when
young Carrington rode down the street
once more, leisurely this time; looking
at everything with interested eyes that
recognized the old and familiar, and
saw the new and changed, with a buoyant
alertness which seemed to match
the careless grace of the way he sat his
horse.</p>

<p>The boy Trevanion had used to see at
play had grown up to this lordliness,
had he? To ride recklessly, careless of
whom he ran down, trusting to luck to
snatch children from under his horse’s
feet. Trevanion hated him.</p>

<p>He saw him rein in the Colonel to
ask some question of a woman who was
leaning her elbows interestedly on her
gatepost. Then young Carrington came
on to stop opposite him.</p>

<p>“You’re just the man I’m looking for,
Trevanion,” he said, and his tone was
clear and crisp.</p>

<p>Trevanion got on his feet and looked
at him loweringly. The child smiled
at him.</p>

<p>“One of these days, Trevanion, I’m
going to let you give me a few lessons
in practical mining,” he said, pleasantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
“I may decide to become a mining man,
after all. But that will have to go for
the present, and you may be thankful
for it. I’m inclined to think you’d find
it harder work than being shift boss.”</p>

<p>Trevanion looked at him unsmilingly.</p>

<p>“However,” young Carrington went
on, “they tell me you’ve never failed in
anything you’ve tried yet, and I’m sure
you wouldn’t begin with me. I’m no
record-breaker,” he laughed, and there
was something so pleasant in its sound
that Trevanion was furious to find that
he liked it.</p>

<p>“No, soberly, Trevanion,” he said, and
his voice dropped to a seriousness that
was sweeter toned than even his laughter,
“father isn’t quite so well to-day.
We’ve got to keep him pretty quiet for
a few days, free from worry as much as
possible; but we don’t want the men to
know that. When he is up again we’ll
get after those Tray-Spot people and
put a stop to those free baths they’ve
been good enough to give us. But we’ve
got to pull him up carefully for a while.
It’ll mean extra work and responsibility
for you.”</p>

<p>Then a new note came in the musical
voice.</p>

<p>“It means everything to the mine just
now, Trevanion, that you are just where
you are, a man to be trusted.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken with a grace
which made them seem like a decoration
conferred. The eyes that Trevanion
raised met deep blue eyes with a
mysterious something in them that conquered
him. Fealty was suddenly strong
in him, loyalty to the lad through thick
and thin. Every fiber of his big burliness
thrilled with a proud protectiveness.
The child on his arm was holding
out his arms to young Carrington.
Three minutes before, his father would
have resented it. Now he saw the firm,
sure, tender grasp with which Carrington
took him up before him on the
saddle; he exulted in the child’s laugh
as the Colonel walked off daintily, then
took a bit of a canter down the street,
and finally young Carrington brought
a reluctant two-year-old back to the
fatherly arms.</p>

<p>It was then that he said what he had
had in his mind since morning&mdash;said it
with a tenderness that rang perfectly
true:</p>

<p>“All I was thinking of this morning,
Trevanion, was to get to my father as
soon as possible. But if my impatience
had resulted in accident I should never
have gotten over it.”</p>

<p>And Dick Trevanion, holding the little,
warm, happy figure close in his
great arms, said what half an hour ago
he had never thought to say:</p>

<p>“I believe you, Mr. Ned.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“Quiet!” said Mr. Kipley, to young
Carrington’s comment, as he sat on the
veranda steps that evening after dinner,
looking with growing approval at
that young gentleman as he lounged in
a big wicker chair. “Well, of course, it
tain’t the Boo-lee-vards”&mdash;for Mr. Kipley
had consulted the encyclopedia
painstakingly in order to converse comfortably
with the returning traveler.
“It tain’t the Boo-lee-vards,” he repeated,
with an air of erudition, “but
there <i>are</i> times when Yellow Dog can
have as big a pack of firecrackers tied
to its tail as you’d see anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said the boy, and it was a yes
that coaxed. He was enjoying Mr. Kipley
hugely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Kipley, placidly. “Day
after pay-day occasionally, or when the
lumber-jacks come down from Raegan
camp at Christmas time to get their
money and blow it in before New
Year’s.” Then he chuckled reminiscently.</p>

<p>“They’re queer cusses,” he said.
“One of ’em came in last Christmas that
was a walkin’ woolen store, ’n’ when
he tried to sell mittens and stockin’s by
the hundred pair, they just naturally
locked him up. But he come by ’em
honest, after all. You know,” he explained,
kindly, “these lumber-jacks
can’t get any money while they are in
the woods, but they can trade at the
company’s store there, ’n’ have it
checked against their time. ’N’ they
<i>will</i> play poker. So they used mittens
’n’ stockings for chips. ’N’ this fellow
had got most of ’em. He told <i>me</i>,”
said Mr. Kipley, with intense enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
“that he won eleven hundred pair
of mittens on three aces. The other
fellow had kings. ’N’ he bluffed forty
pair of stockings outen a greenhorn on
ace high.</p>

<p>“You play poker?” he inquired, for
young Carrington’s laugh had been deliciously
prompt.</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>“Enough to appreciate a good poker
story, anyway,” he said. “That’s a
corker.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley wiped his mouth with his
handkerchief to hide a pleased smile.</p>

<p>“D’you know,” he said, “Mis’ Kipley
can’t see a thing in that story?” His
tone suggested a puzzled commiseration.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” the boy said, gayly, “it’s
hardly a woman’s story, you know.”
And he showed his white teeth in so
gleeful a smile that it warmed Mr. Kipley’s
heart.</p>

<p>It resulted in his making some inquiries
on a subject that had roused his interest
earlier in the day.</p>

<p>“Paris is gettin’ kind of run down,
ain’t it?” he asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said the boy; “it’s getting
built up. What made you think
so?”</p>

<p>“They’s a picture in the encyclopedia,”
said Mr. Kipley, “that I come
acrost to-day. What a lot a person would
know who’d read ’em all through!” he
commented. “It was a cathedral&mdash;Catholic,
I s’pose, ’n’ they’re usually willin’
to give liberal to keep up their buildin’s,
too. It was pretty well timbered up
the back, ’s though they was expecting
a cave-<i>out</i>.”</p>

<p>Young Carrington recognized the description
with an inward joy.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the most famous
churches of Paris,” he said, soberly.
“Notre Dame. And it was built that
way on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Do they <i>believe</i> that?” Mr. Kipley
inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said young Carrington.</p>

<p>“Who give it its name?” Kipley demanded.</p>

<p>“I really couldn’t say,” the boy
laughed.</p>

<p>“It would be interestin’ to know,” reflected
Mr. Kipley. “Of course he wa’n’t
no kind of an architect, or he wouldn’t
have had to brace his walls like that;
but whether he had the gall to name it
because he didn’t care a damn, or they
named it because it wasn’t worth a
damn&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your pa’s waked up and wanted to
know where you was,” said Mrs. Kipley,
appearing in the door, just as young
Carrington was trying to decide whether
to enlighten an ignorance which was
such bliss to the listener.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, and sped into
the house at once.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley turned a philosopher’s eye
upon the wife of his bosom.</p>

<p>“He’s got good principles, M’r’,” he
said, with conviction; “’n’ a very entertainin’
way of puttin’ things. He’s
good company.”</p>

<p>“What was he talkin’ about?” asked
Mrs. Kipley, interestedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley’s cough was extremely
apologetic.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I guess I did
most of the talkin’,” he said, with some
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I should say ’t was likely,” said Mrs.
Kipley, dryly; and she disappeared in
the house. She reappeared for a parting
shot. “I s’pose his principles was
good because he agreed with you,” she
observed, sarcastically. Mr. Kipley
gazed at the evening star confidentially.</p>

<p>“Beats all about women!” he mused.
“They act’s if all the principles was
theirs, ’n’ kind of exasperated if you’ve
got any. ’N’ more if you ain’t,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>He had refilled his pipe, and was
looking placidly across the lights of the
town to the hills beyond.</p>

<p>Hemmy came up the walk with the
light of a new and lovely romantic suggestion
in her eyes.</p>

<p>She sat down beside her father and
slipped a warm, plump hand in his.</p>

<p>“Pa,” she said, sweetly, “am I really
your child and ma’s?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley recoiled sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Miss Hematite Kipley experienced a
pang of disappointment.</p>

<p>She had just been reading a “perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
lovely romance,” where an
adopted child turned out to be the
daughter of a duke. While she did not
insist on a dukedom, she had had an
ecstatic feeling that she might be a millionairess.</p>

<p>“You never brought me home in your
arms and told ma that a beautiful
young gypsy girl&mdash;&mdash;” she began, falteringly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Kipley, with precision;
“I never did, and that’s the reason
I’m alive to-day. If I’d come home
with a baby, talking about beautiful
young gypsies, there’d have been a funeral,
and no mourners. An ’t would
have served me right, too.”</p>

<p>Then he softened parentally toward
this young woman of his own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem so very long ago,
Hemmy, since you was born. Born in
the regular, genu-wine way. Why, we
named you Hematite because they
struck the big find of ore in the mine
that same morning. It was my idea,
too, for your aunt, who lived in the
copper country, had just named her little
girl Amygdoloid&mdash;Amy, for short&mdash;and
she was plum offensive about having
the most elegant name out. ‘What’s
the matter with Hematite?’ says I!”</p>

<p>Miss Hematite kissed her undoubted
parent forgivingly, and rose from the
ashes of her air castle like an undiscouraged
young phœnix.</p>

<p>Already she had another in process
of construction, and she pillowed her
cheek against the battered volume containing
the encounter between Cophetua
and the beggar maid, though <i>he</i> was
not a king, and <i>she</i> was not pauperized.
“I think, perhaps, it’s even <i>sweeter</i>,”
she whispered, as she fell asleep.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Down in the village of Yellow Dog,
the club which the Star had built for
its miners was ablaze not only with
lights, but with excitement.</p>

<p>There was a circle of miners around
the room.</p>

<p>In the center of the floor lay a man
who had been shaken into a little heap
of clothes; a heap that stirred with
caution even in catching breath, lest
more punishment should follow.</p>

<p>Over it towered Dick Trevanion’s
sturdy figure, made brawnier still by
rage.</p>

<p>“Any more remarks about Mr. Ned
and his clothes?” he demanded, sweeping
that quiet group with furious eyes.</p>

<p>There was not a breath from them.
Trevanion’s reputation as an athlete
and a boxer was a matter of local pride.</p>

<p>He walked across the room to the
door and flung it open.</p>

<p>Then he turned his flushed face to
them.</p>

<p>“You can all have as much and more,
if you like,” he said. “I stand for him.”</p>

<p>He struck the side of the door a blow
with his closed fist, a blow that seemed
to shake the entire side of the room.
“Remember that when your tongues
start,” he emphasized, and was gone in
the darkness.</p>

<p>There was no danger that they would
forget.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In a quiet bedroom, the lad whom he
had championed had fallen asleep in
a big chair beside his father’s bed.</p>

<p>He had sat there till John Carrington
had slept, and then, too drowsy to
move, had slept himself&mdash;that youthful
sleep of healthy exhaustion.</p>

<p>John Carrington, waking in the night,
looked at the boy as he rested his head
in the corner of the high-backed chair.
The long, dark lashes lay lightly on
cheeks rounded daintily enough for a
girl, but the lines of the firm young chin
had a quiet decision even now.</p>

<p>Far into the night John Carrington
lay with open eyes resting on his son,
and in the depths of those eyes was
content immeasurable.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The days stretched into weeks, weeks
to months. It was September now.</p>

<p>John Carrington was almost convalescent.</p>

<p>He could walk now with a crutch
from his bedroom to the veranda couch.
The bone had knit, but the flesh was
slow to heal.</p>

<p>And what a comfort his son had been
to him through those months!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Sunny. Tireless. Capable. Ready
to read if he wanted to be read to; to
write letters when they had to be written;
to amuse him with tales of his life
and Elenore’s in Paris, when the pain
was bad and time dragged.</p>

<p>And outside there was not a miner
who did not speak boastingly of Mr.
Ned. Even Yellow Dog, noncommittal
Yellow Dog, sang his praises.</p>

<p>Only the miners at the Tray-Spot
sneered. Only their wives flung a contemptuous
laugh when young Carrington
and the Colonel sped by out on long
rides through the country.</p>

<p>These rides, in whose solitude one
might think one’s own mind freely; and
certain letters that went overseas addressed
to one E. Carrington, to be held
in Paris till called for, were the only
relaxations in which young Carrington
permitted himself an entire honesty of
thought.</p>

<p>One morning Mr. Kipley came home
jubilant.</p>

<p>“Strangers in town,” he announced.
“Owner of the Tray-Spot, I guess, and
a young fellow. Saw them driving with
Richards.”</p>

<p>John Carrington rapped his crutch
sharply against a chair.</p>

<p>“Now there’s going to be something
doing,” he said, defiantly; and all the
repressed activity of months rang in
the words.</p>

<p>Young Carrington waved a hand airily
in the direction of the other mine.</p>

<p>“The Tray-Spot shall cease from
troubling,” he said, gayly, “and we’ll
just gather you gently in.”</p>

<p>If anything stirred the stillness, it
was the mocking laughter of the goddess
of fate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>The brownstone house on Madison
Avenue suggested the solid and respectable
affluence of its owner, Mr.
Livingstone Wade, in that quieter old
New York way which preceded Millionaire’s
Row, and which, on account
of that precedence, Mr. Livingstone
Wade considered immeasurably superior.</p>

<p>Nor was this suggestion a mere exterior
effect.</p>

<p>The somber elegance of its interior
furnishings showed in every detail that
Mr. Wade’s conservatism to earlier
ideals was unfaltering.</p>

<p>The ormolu clock on the drawing-room
mantel was flanked by a pair of
tall vases, Sèvres, as a matter of course,
standing equidistant with the precision
of sentinels.</p>

<p>His pictures included a Landseer, a
Meissonier, a Bouguereau, and some
excellent copies of Raphael. He was
fond of calling your attention to the
fact that all of these gentlemen could
draw, and that their figures “stood
out.”</p>

<p>The books in his library showed a
strong tendency to run in sets, with
modern fiction conspicuously absent.
And as for his dinner services, they
were complete, and he considered odd
sets of plates as a fad which had its
origin in economy or inefficient housekeeping.</p>

<p>He rated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’art nouveau</i> with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveaux
riches</i>, considered impressionism as a
cloak for defective draughtsmanship,
declined to admit anything made as far
west as Rookwood to the companionship
of the Capodamonte and Meissen
in his cabinets, and would have banished
to his stables the most priceless
Indian basket ever made.</p>

<p>West of New York he considered
that the wilderness howled, impelled to
such mournful vocalization by a dawning
sense of its own abnormal crudities.</p>

<p>In business, however, Mr. Wade consented
to compromise with the spirit of
the times. No out-of-date methods
characterized the bank of which he was
president, nor, on the other hand, did
any up-to-date crook contrive to outwit
the keen-eyed, white-haired, thin-lipped
old gentleman, who held himself as
erect ethically as he did physically.</p>

<p>His wife, born a Van Dorn, christened
in Grace Church and married in
the same, had died at fifty-seven, childless&mdash;a
course of conduct which Mr.
Wade, while he preserved a high silence,
felt as deeply as a European
monarch might have done. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
a mere personal question, but the continuation
of the Wade line would have
been for the good of the country at
large.</p>

<p>As for his only nephew, he had done
his duty by him. Not extravagantly, to
spoil the young man, or delude him with
unfounded hopes of heirship; but by
a college course, Columbia <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bien entendu</i>!
and when he determined to become
an architect, the Beaux Arts was
naturally the only correct place.</p>

<p>When he read John Carrington’s letter,
with its phrase “since you have no
direct heir,” Mr. Livingstone Wade experienced
a very primitive bitterness,
which resolved itself into a determination
to make his nephew heir to that
particular piece of property at least;
to recall him from Paris, and to insist
upon his going out to Michigan and becoming
thoroughly conversant with the
mine as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Having begun the accomplishment
of this design, Mr. Livingstone Wade
began to feel a consciousness of benevolence
in acting so generously toward
the young man, which resulted, very
naturally, in his regarding his nephew
with more affection than even Mr.
Wade himself would have thought possible.</p>

<p>As they sat together in the well-ordered
library, Mr. Wade said to himself
that he had done well.</p>

<p>“When the mine came to us with that
tangle of collateral from the Riley failure,
I found that it was paying dividends
regularly; and Richards, the
manager, wrote me that they could be
doubled easily if he was allowed a free
hand to cut down expenses and exercise
his own judgment. He has done it,
too, and the mine is a splendid property.
And it is yours, my boy, when you
have made yourself thoroughly conversant
with it.” Mr. Wade’s tone was
complacently benevolent.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you want me to
take a course in mining engineering?”
said Hastings, and his voice was carefully
expressionless.</p>

<p>“No,” said his uncle; “I want you
to go out to the mine itself, put yourself
in Richards’ hands, and get a good
working knowledge of the proposition,
so that Richards will know you are master.
He wouldn’t try any tricks with
me, because it is pretty well known that
men who have tried have repented it;
but with a young fellow like you, it’s
different, of course. I shall not expect
you to spend all your time there. Perhaps
for a year or so you’d better stay
on the ground. Then come East, open
your architect’s office, and go West
once a year on a tour of inspection.”</p>

<p>Hastings’ face cleared.</p>

<p>“It is more than good of you, sir.
I’ll try to deserve it,” he said, frankly.</p>

<p>“There is only one condition,” Mr.
Wade went on, “and your word is
sufficient for that. You are not to sell
the mine without my consent. The
very fact that John Carrington is so
anxious to get hold of it is one of the
best points in its favor.”</p>

<p>“Carrington?” said Hastings, mechanically,
wondering if the name so
constantly in his thoughts had begun
to repeat itself audibly.</p>

<p>“He is a&mdash;a boor&mdash;who owns the adjoining
mine,” Mr. Wade classified him.
“He offered to buy the Tray-Spot. Of
course I declined. And he had the insolence
to charge Richards with flooding
his mine with water from ours, instead
of pumping it to the surface.
Threatened us with a lawsuit if we
didn’t put in additional pumps. He said
his men were not educated to the luxury
of free baths as yet, and that swimming
was an unpopular sport on the
eleventh level.”</p>

<p>“But if it was true?” said Hastings.</p>

<p>“Of course it wasn’t,” said Mr.
Wade, testily. “I wrote Richards, and
he said Carrington was just trying to
get hold of the mine, and wouldn’t stop
at anything to do it, because his, the
Star, is down so deep it is about
worked out. Do you know,” Mr. Wade
went on, “this John Carrington had the
audacity to say that, since I’d never
been West, he didn’t suppose I’d care
to begin such trips <i>at my age</i>, and that,
as I had no son, he should think a reasonable
proposition to sell ought to interest
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade intended to suggest only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
John Carrington’s breach of good manners,
but in spite of himself his voice
showed where the taunt stung. And
Hastings had a sudden comprehension
of his uncle’s sudden benevolence,
which in its very humanness quickened
him from his heavy sense of indebtedness
for benefits received, into
that warmer loyalty of the ties of blood,
into that sense of inter-dependence
which this was the first emergency to
rouse.</p>

<p>He began to feel ashamed of the
sense of injury he had had in the
abrupt summons to quit Paris, to put
away his chosen profession for a time.
He began to feel ashamed of the lagging
gratitude with which he had received
a gift which would make him a
rich man; of that involuntary wish that
his uncle’s generosity had taken another
form.</p>

<p>A realization of the loneliness of age
bound him to the older man with bonds
of sentiment stronger far, with warmhearted,
generous youth, than all those
the government has seen fit to issue.</p>

<p>But Carrington? Though there
might be dozens of Carringtons who
owned mines in the West.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Holliday’s car&mdash;he’s offered
it to me time and again&mdash;and go
out there. We can live on the car the
few days I am here, and you’re young
and can manage to make yourself comfortable
afterward. I shall be proud to
introduce you as my nephew, Laurence.”
Mr. Wade was tasting victory
in prospect, and the taste was palatable.
“Carrington has only one son, and he’s
daubing canvas in Paris.”</p>

<p>Then this was Elenore’s father.
Hastings foresaw complications to
come.</p>

<p>“Ned Carrington and his sister were
two of my best friends in Paris, sir,”
he said, firmly. “I knew their father
was a mine owner somewhere in the
West.”</p>

<p>“Has this young Carrington any business
ability?” demanded Mr. Wade.
His tone was quick and keen. He was
getting at an important factor.</p>

<p>Hastings smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Not a scrap,” he said, amusedly,
“but he’s a genius. He’ll be a new ‘old
master’ one of these days.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade’s countenance relaxed
amiably.</p>

<p>“These erratic young fellows are always
<i>going</i> to do wonders,” he said,
indulgently. “For all the help he’ll
be to his father, he might as well be a
girl. One of these days you will be
buying out John Carrington on your
own terms.”</p>

<p>Nor did he dream that in the silence
that followed, as he sat comfortably
certain of the discomfiture of the man
who had flung at him the two-edged
taunt of age and childlessness, his
nephew was saying to himself that surely
Elenore’s father must be a reasonable
man, that there must be some rational
basis on which he and John Carrington
could meet as friends. More, he saw
himself with an assured income.
<i>Then</i> could he not, by virtue of that
future friendship, gain a remarkably
valuable ally in that siege of the marvelous
citadel&mdash;invulnerable, indeed,
save to a certain small sportsman who
bends his bow to no man’s dictation,
and yet for love of valor, or from mere
caprice, ranges himself at the unlikeliest
moment with the besieging force,
and wins with a single well-sped shaft?</p>

<p>Whatever emotions the arrival of
Mr. Wade and his nephew at Yellow
Dog excited in Richards, his outward
attitude was one of bluff heartiness.</p>

<p>“You can’t stay on your car, though,
Mr. Wade,” he said, decisively, looking
over its comfortable appointments with
an appraising eye. “The miners at the
Star are too lawless. You’ll have to
put up with the hotel.” (“About
twenty-four hours of the Raegan
House will start them for New York,”
he thought, with grim humor.)</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that they
would dare attack a private car?” Mr.
Wade demanded, aghast.</p>

<p>Richards shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much they wouldn’t
dare,” he said, coolly, wondering how
thick it would be safe to pile it on, “but
they’re more interested in people than
property. The car’s safe enough as
long as you aren’t in it, but if a stick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
dynamite happened to drop under it
some night when you were&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What has made such bad feeling
between the mines?” Hastings asked,
quietly.</p>

<p>Richards’ eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

<p>“Miners take the tone of their manager,”
he said, significantly.</p>

<p>Simple as question and answer were,
antipathy quickened in that instant between
the two men.</p>

<p>Richards resented a certain something
in Hastings’ tone, and Hastings
made up his mind that Richards was
overplaying.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade was regretting with exceeding
heartiness that he had come at
all. Being blown to bits in this desolate-looking
hole was furthest from his
desire.</p>

<p>Trusting himself to the horrors of a
wilderness hotel seemed about as hazardous
an alternative. As for leaving
his nephew in such a place, was it not
virtually condemning him to a more or
less lingering death? And Mr. Wade had
grown amazingly fond of him during
the last few months, in the companionship
which had resulted from their
many-times delayed expedition westward.</p>

<p>He was half inclined to make a
formal tour of inspection, announcing
Hastings as the future owner, and then
take him back and let him open his
architect’s office at once. But Mr.
Wade hated retreat.</p>

<p>“Then I am sure that you have men
equally vigilant in repelling any attacks
upon property or persons,” Hastings
said, smoothly. “However, it doesn’t
matter to me. I should have to come
to the hotel, anyway, later, when you
have gone back, sir.”</p>

<p>“Going to stay with us a while?”
Richards asked him.</p>

<p>“Permanently,” said Hastings, pleasantly.</p>

<p>Richards swung a questioning face
toward Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>“The mine would have been my
nephew’s at my death, naturally, Richards,”
Mr. Wade explained, with some
dignity. “He is coming into his own
a little sooner, that is all. And if he
chooses to remain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As he does,” Hastings laughed, genially,
“and to learn all about his mine
from its competent manager.”</p>

<p>Mr. Richards’ face did not express
any extreme joy.</p>

<p>“If you’ll take my advice, you’ll go
home with your uncle and leave your
mine in my hands, Mr. Hastings,” he
said, bluffly. “It’s a rough country, and
hard, dangerous work&mdash;work that you
don’t know anything about, and that it
will take you years to learn. And&mdash;I
beg your pardon, but I’ll speak plainly&mdash;while
you are learning you’ll want to
give orders, and you’ll make bad mistakes&mdash;expensive
mistakes. They’re
easy to make and hard to right. Not
that it will be your fault. I should if
I tried to run Mr. Wade’s bank. If you
want your mine to keep on being a good
paying proposition, leave it in the
hands of men who made it one. Isn’t
that business, Mr. Wade? I’ve satisfied
you, haven’t I?” His manner had
a certain brusque appeal.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said Mr. Wade, suavely.</p>

<p>Then he looked at Hastings. He was
standing by the table heaped with books
and magazines, and there was something
in the alertness of his virile figure,
well poised enough for a soldier;
something in the lines of his well-cut
features, something in the steadiness
and frankness of the cool gray eyes,
that suggested not only the strength of
youth, but the strength of the spirit.
It came to Mr. Wade suddenly that he
was going to miss him, that the young
fellow ought to have a chance to live
with his own class.</p>

<p>“And my nephew may suit himself,”
Mr. Wade went on, steadily. “The
mine is his without condition”&mdash;he
spoke the words slowly&mdash;“and if he
chooses to leave it in your hands, and
return East with me, he is quite at liberty
to do so.”</p>

<p>Hastings smiled at him cheerfully.</p>

<p>“I shall stay, of course,” he said, decidedly.
“But I’ll try not to make my
mining education too expensive.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a carriage outside,” said
Mr. Richards, rising abruptly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
s’pose you’d like to drive around town
and out to the mine, to look around a
little. Then if you’ll take dinner with
me at the Raegan House, you’ll have
quite an idea what it’s like out here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone Wade surveyed the
landau into which he stepped with scant
favor; and the look which he gave to
the ragged darky who held the reins
was only equaled by the one he bestowed
on the two battered equines who
were to serve as their means of locomotion.</p>

<p>As they swung into the main street
of the little town, Hastings laughed with
a perfectly genuine amusement.</p>

<p>“I might open an architect’s office
here, on the side,” he said. “They certainly
need it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade’s eyes were upon an up-to-date
trap, drawn by a well-matched,
high-stepping pair. The middle-aged
man who was driving turned on them
a look of amused curiosity as they
passed.</p>

<p>“Whom do those horses belong to?”
demanded Mr. Wade, sharply.</p>

<p>“Belong to Carrington,” said Richards,
shortly. “That was his man.
That’s his house at the other end of the
street&mdash;that big one on the hill.” He
jerked his head to indicate that it was
back of them, and they turned to see it.
It had a large, comfortable, hospitable
look, more suggestive of the South
than of the North.</p>

<p>“The hotel’s good enough for me,”
said Richards, dryly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade wondered why this sentiment,
which had seemed so admirable
to him in New York, lost its flavor here
on the ground.</p>

<p>As they passed a blacksmith’s shop,
the smith was shoeing a Kentucky thoroughbred,
who looked at them with an
airy unconcern.</p>

<p>“Carrington’s,” said Richards to Mr.
Wade’s uplifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>The expression on Mr. Wade’s face
was a curious one. Your tourist in Europe
now and then wears its twin, on
discovering that the United States is
renting a second-rate building for an
embassy, when other governments own
pretentious ones.</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Hastings, suddenly.
“I think I shall buy a neat little
touring car to run around here. Pretty
bad grades, but there are half a dozen
makes that could take them easily.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade looked at him with the
ever-growing conviction that he was
the kind of nephew to have. In spite
of his conservatism, he had adopted the
auto as he had the telephone.</p>

<p>“Quite right, Laurence,” he said,
complacently. “When you order the
one you prefer, have the bill sent to me.”</p>

<p>“Going to import a show-fure?”
queried Richards, with ironic pleasantry.</p>

<p>Hastings shook his head.</p>

<p>“Never saw one I couldn’t run yet,”
he said, cheerfully, “and when I do I’ll
send it back to the factory as defective.”</p>

<p>“If he’ll just put in his time running
it, it’s all I’ll ask of him,” communed
Richards with himself.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At two o’clock of that day Mr. Wade
had concluded that all he had ever
heard of the enormities of the West
was far below the actual fact.</p>

<p>His first grievance had been the
dilapidated conveyance; his second the
fact that Richards, who for reasons of
his own had not tried to make the expedition
a bed of roses, had insisted
on his getting out a dozen times to see
certain offices, the shaft house, and a
number of other buildings, about whose
use he was extremely hazy. And these
pilgrimages had necessitated his walking
through fine red dust, which not
only reduced his immaculate footgear
to its lowest terms, but bordered the
bottom of his pale gray trouser legs
with a deep red band, which Richards
assured him was indelible.</p>

<p>But the crowning enormity came
with the dinner at Raegan’s Hotel,
which invitation Mr. Wade had felt he
could hardly refuse in courtesy.</p>

<p>At the moment they entered the dining
room Richards was called to the
phone.</p>

<p>“Take these gentlemen down to my
table, Maggie,” he said to the head
waitress as he turned away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wade regarded this young woman
disapprovingly. The curve of her
pompadour and the curves of her figure
were too aggressively spherical.
That her overgenerous bulk could be
compressed to the dimensions of her
waist seemed to indicate that whalebone
had been unduly overlooked in modern
mechanics. It hinted, too, though not
to Mr. Wade, of a forcefulness of
spirit which, seeing in a handkerchief-sized,
knife-pleated white apron a legitimate
adornment, adjusted the physical,
Spartan-like, to its requirements. But
Mr. Wade’s mere passive and impersonal
dislike quickened to an active rage
in that awful moment when she tucked
her arm comfortably in his, and promenaded
him the length of the dining room
to an untidy looking table already occupied
by a portly Hibernian, who was
engaged in extensive molar exploration
with a diminutive wooden pick.</p>

<p>“Friends of Mr. Richards, Mr.
O’Shaughnessy,” she said, glibly, and
Mr. Wade felt himself released from
her muscular arm only to feel the front
of a chair pressed with energetic purpose
against the back of his knees.</p>

<p>As certain muscles automatically relaxed
to enable him to be seated, his
stunned sense of propriety recovered
consciousness enough to enable him to
decide that of all outrages ever perpetrated
on a gentleman, this last was the
worst.</p>

<p>“Mr. Richards’ friends are my
friends,” responded Mr. O’Shaughnessy,
cordially.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade looked at Hastings, who
was seating himself with outer sobriety
and inward hilarity. He comforted
himself by taking that sobriety for disgust.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are not out here for
your health?” Mr. O’Shaughnessy
opined, genially.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Wade, icily.</p>

<p>“What line ar-re you in?” Mr.
O’Shaughnessy pursued.</p>

<p>“I fail to understand you,” said Mr.
Wade, stiffly.</p>

<p>“What house are you thravelin’ for?
What are you selling?” Mr. O’Shaughnessy
explained.</p>

<p>That he, Mr. Livingstone Wade,
should be taken for a traveling salesman!</p>

<p>“I am a banker,” said Mr. Wade. He
felt it due to himself to say as much as
that.</p>

<p>“Faro and that face of yours ar-re
twins the world over,” said Mr.
O’Shaughnessy, genially, closing one
eye and looking intelligently at Hastings
through the other. Then he cast
the toothpick on the floor. “Have a
cigar?” he said, hospitably, throwing a
couple carelessly on the table as he rose
to depart. “Drop in and see me if you
get thirsty while you’re here. The palm
garden. Two doors up. The house is
good for a few yet.”</p>

<p>He stopped to joke with the head
waitress a moment on his way out.</p>

<p>Richards, returning, decided that Mr.
Wade was pretty well fagged. He had
become monosyllabic.</p>

<p>The catsup bottle in the middle of
the table, the greasy, lukewarm soup in
stone-china bowls, the tasteless profusion
of canned vegetables, the dubious-looking
water, and the muddy mixture,
bitter from long boiling, which the
Raegan House called coffee, were only
additional affronts to a man already at
the limit of his endurance.</p>

<p>His announcement of his intention to
spend the rest of the day in the car, and
to make it his headquarters during his
stay, was delivered with a decision
which left no possibility for protest.</p>

<p>What was mere dynamite to such indignities
as these!</p>

<p>He stepped into the landau, which
Richards had ordered round again, with
a sensation of relief, heightened by that
gentleman’s statement that he shouldn’t
be able to see them again until morning.
Richards found Mr. Wade rather
exhausting, on his side.</p>

<p>“If you see a fellow in freak clothes
on your way back, you can know it’s
that son of Carrington’s,” he observed,
as he stood on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Hastings had his foot on the step of
the landau, but he wheeled.</p>

<p>“Is Ned Carrington here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Been here all summer. Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
broke his leg in a runaway and sent
for him,” Richards growled.</p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll walk over and see
him,” Hastings said promptly, “if you’ll
excuse me, sir.”</p>

<p>He smiled confidently at his uncle.</p>

<p>“You shan’t go near him,” said
Richards, fiercely, “with that shark of a
father of his trying to swindle us every
way he can.”</p>

<p>“Whatever his father is, Ned Carrington
is a gentleman and my friend,”
said Hastings, quietly.</p>

<p>“Tell him he can’t go,” Richards demanded
of Mr. Wade. And his insistence
was fatal. Mr. Wade would
not have influenced his nephew at Richards’
dictation just now if Hastings had
announced his intention of going to perdition.</p>

<p>Moreover, he trusted Hastings. And&mdash;this
is an awful anti-climax&mdash;he
wanted a nap.</p>

<p>“I hope you will find your friend
home, Laurence,” he said, suavely.
“Business quarrels can safely be ignored
between gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Richards, watching the erect old figure
disappearing in the landau toward
the station, and the athletic young one
striding off in the direction of the Star
mine, hated them with an equal intensity.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>John Carrington, dozing away on the
great wicker divan on his broad veranda,
in the warmth of a September
afternoon, opened his eyes at the click
of the gate.</p>

<p>The young man coming rapidly up
the graveled walk was a stranger.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carrington?” he said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Carrington replied.</p>

<p>“Your son and I were friends in
Paris, Mr. Carrington,” he went on.
“My name is Hastings. I hope he is at
home.”</p>

<p>Hastings! Paris! This was the young
fellow whom Sarah had written about&mdash;who
was so attentive to Elenore.</p>

<p>Carrington looked at him critically,
and was pleased.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Hastings,” he said,
cordially. “Ned just went in to order
the horses for a little later. He will be
out presently, and will be glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“I was surprised to hear that Ned
was here, Mr. Carrington,” Hastings
went on, seating himself. “He was to
start for the East with Velantour the
day I left Paris, and I supposed he was
painting away for dear life somewhere
in the Vale of Cashmere.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t even know he intended to
go,” said Carrington, quietly.</p>

<p>“What!” said Hastings. “He hasn’t
told you that Velantour asked him to
go? It was the greatest opportunity he
could ever have!” Then he thought.
“Of course your illness was first with
him,” he said. “I hope I haven’t been
telling tales out of school.” He smiled
frankly. Then “He’s a genius,
though.” The praise burst out spontaneously.
“They expect great things of
him in Paris, Mr. Carrington.”</p>

<p>John Carrington did some rapid
thinking. So the boy had put aside the
biggest opportunity in his life to come
back to him. Put it aside cheerfully. To
gratify&mdash;John Carrington was hard on
himself now&mdash;his father’s selfish pride.
The need had not been imperative. He
could have written him all the questions
it was advisable to ask him. But he had
been in pain, and harassed, and he had
sacrificed the boy to it. Well, he should
go back soon. He, John Carrington,
was not so near senility that he couldn’t
manage his own affairs. His jaw set
squarely.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me, Mr. Hastings,”
he said, calmly. Quick steps were
coming through the hall. “Before he
had a chance to head you off,” he concluded,
smilingly. The eyes he turned
toward the door were very proud.
“Here’s a friend you’ll be glad to see,”
he said, cheerily. Yet it seemed to him,
and to Hastings, that the lad’s first impulse
was toward recoil.</p>

<p>He certainly paled a little. And Hastings
said to himself that Ned had, in
some subtle way, changed indefinably,
but certainly. His eyes did not carry
out the comfortable familiarity of his
attire. It appeared to Hastings that
they were making some demand upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
him&mdash;a demand that he could not understand.</p>

<p>But the next second young Carrington
came forward with at least a surface
cordiality.</p>

<p>“How did you find me out&mdash;Hastings?”
he said, with a slight hesitation
before the name, as perplexing as the
characteristic grasp of his hand, familiar
and unfamiliar at once, and the
tinge of formality that obtruded itself
unmistakably.</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were here until I
heard it just now from Richards,” said
Hastings, struggling with a vague sense
of rebuff.</p>

<p>The name might have been the Medusa
head.</p>

<p>Then “Richards?” John Carrington
queried. Hastings flushed.</p>

<p>“My uncle, Mr. Wade, has given me
the Tray-Spot mine,” he said, and his
voice became formal in turn. “We
lunched with our manager to-day.”</p>

<p>In spite of his annoyance, his lips
twitched at the memory of it.</p>

<p>“It seems that there is war between
the two mines, Mr. Carrington;” he
turned to the older man. “I don’t know
anything of mining, but there must be
some way out of it which would be just
both to your interests and to ours.”</p>

<p>For John Carrington had impressed
him indelibly as an honest man.</p>

<p>Hastings’ tone was both dignified and
frank. John Carrington liked it. But
could good come out of anything connected
with the Tray-Spot? It had always
been a thorn in the flesh.</p>

<p>Ned had crossed the veranda quickly,
to seat himself behind a book-laden table.
Once so ensconced, he drew a long
breath of relief. Then he began to look
amused.</p>

<p>“We have suggested a way, but it did
not meet with your uncle’s approval,”
said John Carrington, quietly.</p>

<p>“I quite agree with my uncle that we
do not care to sell,” said Hastings,
calmly.</p>

<p>“Nor, I assume, do you care to discharge
your manager,” John Carrington
went on.</p>

<p>“No,” said Hastings, frankly again;
“my uncle has always considered Richards
an invaluable man.”</p>

<p>“He certainly has been,” Carrington
commented, ironically. “Then, I think
we can cut out mining as a topic of conversation,
Mr. Hastings. You and Ned
can gossip about Paris.”</p>

<p>“That’s where I differ with you, dad,”
Ned broke in, spiritedly.</p>

<p>Hastings, stung, started to rise, but
“Don’t be silly,” the lad said, impatiently,
but with more friendliness than
he had yet shown. “We may have a
thousand pleasant things to say about
Paris, but this is the important thing,
and we had better keep at it.</p>

<p>“Laurence”&mdash;Hastings gave a little
start; Ned had never called him Laurence&mdash;“is
quite as much of a greenhorn
about mines as I was a few months ago.
It’s only fair to tell him just what our
position is. He will at least hear a story
of our grievances that hasn’t been garbled.”
His tone was spirited.</p>

<p>“I should like that,” said Hastings,
quietly.</p>

<p>Ned leaned forward eagerly. Then
he settled his cravat with a peculiar
twist, which Hastings recognized as
Ned’s characteristic preliminary to discourse.
He and Elenore had laughed
over it many times together.</p>

<p>“Ours is the older and deeper mine,”
Ned began. “That’s the first thing.
And all the mines here strike the big
bodies of water in sinking. That’s the
second. Your manager has hit on the
economical plan of doing without large
pumps; and when you strike water, he
lets it seep through to us, and we raise
it for you. It increases our dangers
and expenses and your dividends. How
would you like it in our place?”</p>

<p>John Carrington watched him with a
look of mingled pride and amusement.</p>

<p>“In the case you have stated, I
shouldn’t like it at all,” Hastings stated,
coolly. “But Richards has assured my
uncle that this grievance of yours is imaginary;
that the water you get comes
from your own sinking. Isn’t there a
possibility that may be so?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ned, positively; “there
isn’t.”</p>

<p>Hastings hesitated. That Ned believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
what he was saying was obvious;
but, after all, what did he know about
it? Wasn’t he, save in his art, the most
impractical soul living? Why shouldn’t
it be quite as likely that Carrington’s
men deceived him as that Richards deceived
his uncle?</p>

<p>“There ought to be the simplest of
ways of settling that,” he said, slowly.
“Let a couple of your men go down our
mine and satisfy themselves that we’re
doing what’s right.”</p>

<p>John Carrington’s laugh was ironically
amused.</p>

<p>“You might suggest that to Richards,”
he said. Then his tone changed.
“He won’t even give us a map of your
workings,” he said, sharply. “As for
letting anyone from the Star underground,
he has announced pretty clearly
that the man who tried it wouldn’t come
up again. And though Richards’ word
hasn’t any par value, I am willing to believe
that for once he meant what he
said.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you painting Richards in
rather too black a color?” Hastings protested.
“Aren’t you unduly prejudiced
against him? Premeditated murder,
now?”</p>

<p>“Accident, my dear sir,” John Carrington
said, ironically, “and underground
accidents are almost too easy.”</p>

<p>Hastings hesitated. He looked at Ned.</p>

<p>The lad made a Gallic gesture that
sent his hands far apart. “What would
you?” it signified.</p>

<p>There was a tinge of mockery in his
friendly smile. Yet something of confidence,
too.</p>

<p>“My dear Hastings,” he said; “it is
decidedly up to you. Our word or Richards’.”</p>

<p>Hastings flushed.</p>

<p>“My dear Ned,” he said, steadily,
“that I should doubt your good faith is
impossible. Nor,” he flared, “do I
think you doubt mine. I have been
thrust suddenly, through the great generosity
of an uncle to whom I am as
loyal as you are to your father, into a
situation that I know nothing about. I
have a manager in whom my uncle, a
cautious man, has believed implicitly.
You tell me this man is a rogue. But
you may be wrong. I can’t condemn
him unheard. One thing is certain,”
he went on. “I shall find out. And if
there has been anything crooked about
our management, it shall be righted.”
The line of his lips straightened. The
muscles of his jaw grew tense. It was
impossible to doubt that he meant what
he said.</p>

<p>Both listeners believed him. Both admired
him. But John Carrington looked
his admiration frankly, and young Carrington
dropped his eyelids satisfiedly
over his.</p>

<p>“That is all we could ask,” said John
Carrington, approvingly. “Now let me
hear you youngsters chat about Paris.”</p>

<p>But Hastings was impatient to be off
now.</p>

<p>“I must get back to my uncle,” he
said, lightly. “It has been a hard day
for him, and I suggested that I would
serve as secretary for once.”</p>

<p>“Then, order the horses round for
Mr. Hastings, Ned,” said John Carrington,
and as the lad disappeared, and
Hastings protested: “They are standing
harnessed in the stable,” he said, decisively.
“You mustn’t insist on our being
too inhospitable.”</p>

<p>And as Hastings capitulated, John
Carrington followed out a sudden impulse.</p>

<p>“You will explain to your uncle that
this half-mended leg of mine will prevent
my calling on him,” he stated, feeling
suddenly that Hastings’ uncle must
have some good points, “but I shall be
glad to put my horses at his disposal
while he is here. Ned will come over to
your car in the morning, and say so
gracefully.”</p>

<p>He smiled confidently at the returning
lad.</p>

<p>There was a queer, contented look
lurking in the lad’s eyes. “As gracefully
as he can,” he laughed, lightly.
“I’ll walk down to the gate with you,”
he added.</p>

<p>It was on the way to the gate that
Hastings asked the question which was
really the mainspring of his call.</p>

<p>“Where is your sister now? Did she
go to Brittany?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Young Carrington seemed amused.</p>

<p>“Elenore’s plans were rather upset
this summer,” he said, lightly, “as well
as mine. She’s far from Brittany, in a
curious little place you never heard of
in France.” He was rather proud of
the way that sentence was turned.
“She’s with a friend, and enjoying herself,
though she says it’s all queer.”</p>

<p>Hastings had a mental vision of Elenore
in some far-off corner of France,
making gay over all its out-of-the-way
absurdities in that companionable way
of hers.</p>

<p>“I wish she were here,” he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I dare say she’d rather be
where she is than anywhere else,” Ned
rejoined, carelessly.</p>

<p>Which was cold comfort to Hastings.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said, turning, as he
was about to step into the trap, “I suppose
we’re perfectly safe to make our
headquarters in the car here?”</p>

<p>“Safe as the Waldorf, if you’re on a
siding,” Ned laughed. “If you stay on
the main track the cars will hit you.”</p>

<p>Hastings mentally swore at himself.
The question had sounded idiotic.</p>

<p>“See you in the morning,” Ned
called, as Hastings drove off. But he
walked back to the house rather slowly.</p>

<p>“Pretty tired, dad?” he asked, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Ned,” said John Carrington, slowly,
“when you children were little I’m
afraid I loved Elenore best. But no
daughter can be to a man what his son
is.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence. John Carrington
lay with his eyes closed. He
was tired.</p>

<p>“Do you think Elenore was interested
in that young fellow?” he asked, finally.</p>

<p>“If she was, she never said so,” young
Carrington replied. He was looking off
in the direction of the Tray-Spot.</p>

<p>“If I were a girl, I’m inclined to
think he could have me,” John Carrington
announced.</p>

<p>Young Carrington’s laugh was lightly
amused.</p>

<p>“If I were a girl, I’d lead him on a
bit, myself,” he announced.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>When Hastings had returned to the
car the afternoon before, he told his uncle
the story of his interview with the
Carringtons quite simply. He was too
wise to urge action upon a tired, out-of-temper
man; nor did he wait for Mr.
Wade’s comment. He shifted conversation
to pleasanter things, and by the
time Joseph had served them a nice little
dinner Mr. Wade’s outer man bore
the visible signs of gastronomic peace.
A few games of cribbage, which he
won, yet not too easily, were also a
soothing influence. When Hastings said
good-night, Mr. Wade opened the subject
of his own accord.</p>

<p>“How did this claim of Carrington’s
strike you, Laurence?”</p>

<p>“It struck me that we must satisfy
ourselves about it as a matter of personal
honor,” said Hastings, firmly. “Of
course you will know better than I
how and when to take the initiative.”</p>

<p>There was nothing that urged or insisted
in his tone. It was quietly assured.</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir,” he smiled, and disappeared.
Disappeared to dream that
the car was a balloon, and that he was
sailing swiftly through sunny skies to
Elenore.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone Wade, over-fatigued,
was jolted through dreamland by that
unbridled nocturnal equine who bolts
from one disaster to another.</p>

<p>The horror-stricken Mr. Wade found
himself lunching at Sherry’s with the
head waitress from Raegan’s. She had
tied that knife-pleated apron around her
neck, like a bib; and she told him things
were “elegunt,” and he could call her
Maggie.</p>

<p>She insisted on his drinking catsup
instead of claret, and ordered the salad
compounded with soft hematite instead
of paprika.</p>

<p>All the directors of the bank were
seated at a table near them; and they
looked quite as appalled as Mr. Wade
felt <i>he</i> would, had he seen any one of
them in his place.</p>

<p>How he came to be in this awful predicament,
he had no idea. He only knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
that he was riveted to his chair, and that
his face, in spite of his inward horror,
<i>would</i> wear a pleased smile. And speech,
though he strove desperately to articulate,
was an impossibility.</p>

<p>Then Hastings appeared, and said seriously:
“This, sir, is a matter that affects
your personal honor.”</p>

<p>It was in a grim determination to escape
from this purgatory at all hazards
that Mr. Wade finally jumped himself
awake; and though every muscle in his
body ached throbbingly, he gave a sigh
of contentment as he stirred his face on
his pillow.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Trevanion, coming up to the house on
a summons from John Carrington,
found young Carrington coming down
the steps, looking a bit more of a
swashbuckling dandy than ever.</p>

<p>“Morning, Trevanion,” he greeted
him, buoyantly.</p>

<p>Then he nodded toward the waiting
trap.</p>

<p>“I’m going to pay a morning call on
the owners of the Tray-Spot,” he announced,
genially.</p>

<p>“Confound ’em!” muttered Trevanion.</p>

<p>The lad looked him straight in the
eyes, in the way Trevanion found so remarkable.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think they’re square,” he said,
lightly, “and that Richards’ day is about
done. It will decide itself in a few
days now, anyway.”</p>

<p>Trevanion watched him with a curious
expression as he drove off.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. Wade had wakened not only refreshed
but in a mood which a certain
irreverent clerk had once characterized
as his “dusting off the earth day” and a
good time to lie low. Hastings greeted
the morning sun joyfully, because it
shone on the little town where Elenore
had spent her childhood.</p>

<p>Richards came in just as they were
enjoying their after-breakfast cigars.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, dropping into a chair
without preliminary greetings, or waiting
for Mr. Wade to request him to do
so, “what’s the program for to-day?”</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell on Mr. Wade’s
trouser legs.</p>

<p>“Told you it wouldn’t come off, didn’t
I?” he laughed, boisterously.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade resented Richards’ unceremonious
entrance, and resented still
more this direct allusion to his sartorial
disfigurement, which had resisted the
most zealous efforts of Joseph. He considered
that, under present circumstances,
the legs should be considered as
analogous to those of the Queen of
Spain.</p>

<p>And that phrase of Hastings, “a matter
of personal honor,” had hit the
bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade prided himself first that
the family fortune had been made honestly,
by the rise in Manhattan real estate;
and last, that the Wade name
stood in the business world to-day as a
symbol of integrity that erred, if it erred
at all, on the side of over-scrupulousness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Richards,” he said, a trifle
stiffly, “when I inquired into the matter,
you wrote me that Mr. Carrington’s
grievance had no foundation in fact, did
you not?”</p>

<p>The bluffness faded out of Richards’
face and left ugliness disclosed.</p>

<p>“He brought that old yarn back with
him from Carrington’s yesterday, I suppose,”
he sneered, jerking his head toward
Hastings.</p>

<p>Hastings had that rare faculty of
knowing when to let the game play itself.</p>

<p>“Very naturally, Mr. Richards,” said
Mr. Wade, with dangerous smoothness;
“but that is not the question.”</p>

<p>Richards’ face darkened.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what the question is, Mr.
Wade, and you can settle it right now,”
he snarled. “It’s whether you are going
to take the word of the man who has
made the mine, or the word of the man
who’s trying to blackmail it, so’s he can
buy it cheap.”</p>

<p>It was a good issue, so good that
Richards himself was proud of it. He
leaned back in his chair with something
of a swagger.</p>

<p>“That you are still in charge of the
Tray-Spot is the best proof of my confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in you,” Mr. Wade said, in a
more gracious tone, “but I propose to
place the Carringtons in a position
where they will have to admit that they
are in the wrong, as you say they are.
We will tell them that they may send a
representative through our mine at any
time, and that he will be accorded every
courtesy.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life, we won’t!” said
Richards, fiercely.</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. Wade, serenely, “is
a matter where we differ.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” Richards went on,
working himself into a rage, “that anyone
they sent down would come up and
tell the truth? He’d say just what he
was paid to say, and he’d find just what
he was paid to find.”</p>

<p>Joseph entered with two cards, and
thereby effected a diversion.</p>

<p>One of the cards bore the name of
Mr. John Carrington and the other that
of Mr. Edward Carrington.</p>

<p>The gods fought on the Carrington
side.</p>

<p>“Show him in,” said Mr. Wade,
suavely.</p>

<p>Young Carrington, debonair as a
certain Monsieur Beaucaire, made his
entrance with an easy grace. The delicate
deference of his manner toward
Mr. Wade, the pleasant <i>camaraderie</i>
which he showed to Hastings, the impersonal
politeness with which he recognized
Richards’ existence, were all
points in his favor.</p>

<p>So, too, were his punctiliousness in
making his father’s excuses, and the
quiet courtesy with which he placed his
horses at Mr. Wade’s disposal.</p>

<p>His manner was so free from embarrassment
or assertiveness, so evidently
inspired by a nice sense of proprieties,
that he might have been the ambassador
of one king to another.</p>

<p>Richards, retiring to one of the car
windows, his back toward them all, his
fingers beating a nerve-racking tattoo
upon the glass, was his direct antithesis.</p>

<p>“My nephew tells me you have distinct
ability as an artist,” Mr. Wade
said, when, the preliminary interchange
of courtesies over, the three were comfortably
seated. Mr. Wade thought it
was likely, too.</p>

<p>“Then, I may tell you that we expect
him to be one of our best architects,”
young Carrington returned, gracefully.</p>

<p>“The rising architect of Yellow Dog,”
Hastings said, with a wave of his hands.
“I think I shall begin by building a little
bungalow here for myself.”</p>

<p>“A very good idea,” said Mr. Wade,
decisively.</p>

<p>Hastings’ first phrase had smitten him
with a sudden contrition. He felt, too,
that if he was going to come out to Yellow
Dog himself, and if his nephew
stayed there he should, of course, come
out once a year, at least, a cozily built
bungalow, where he might be made
comfortable, was in the line of a necessity.
“I should get about it at once,”
he declared.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to drive about
this morning, and select your site for
‘A Bungalow for One,’” said young
Carrington, laughingly. There was a
slightly mocking emphasis on the last
word.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have it too small,” said
Mr. Wade, firmly.</p>

<p>Richards was whistling between his
teeth now, a performance which always
enraged Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>“But we will have to let the site go
for this morning, at least;” and there
was a precise distinctness about Mr.
Wade’s words now. “Mr. Richards has
just been arranging to take us down
the mine this morning.”</p>

<p>Richards wheeled round, surprised.</p>

<p>Young Carrington rose with an unhurried
ease.</p>

<p>“Then, I must not detain you,” he
said, calmly.</p>

<p>“And why would it not be a good
idea for you to send one of your men,
in whom you have full confidence, down
with us?”&mdash;Mr. Wade’s tone was entirely
urbane. “He would, perhaps, be
able not only to assure himself of actual
conditions, but to explain your contention
to us in the workings under discussion.”</p>

<p>Richards held himself tense.</p>

<p>“I should like to send our shift boss,
with your permission,” said young Carrington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
quietly, though inwardly he exulted.
“I will have him meet you at
your shaft house whenever you say.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wade,” said Richards, and the
effort he made to control himself made
the veins in his face distend purplingly,
“when Mr. John Carrington is well
enough to go down our mine, I shall be
glad”&mdash;how the word choked him&mdash;“to
take him down myself; but Trevanion,
their shift boss, is at the bottom of the
trouble. He’s tricky and dishonest. I’d
rather resign than take him down the
mine.”</p>

<p>For in the time that would elapse before
John Carrington was able to take
such a jaunt much could be done.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, in which
Richards’ claim and Carrington’s were
equi-balanced. The very fact of Hastings’
personal bias held him inactive.</p>

<p>Then young Carrington spoke.</p>

<p>“I will answer for Trevanion’s honesty
with my own,” he said. There was
an emotional note in the voice he tried to
hold steady.</p>

<p>“Off the same piece, <i>I</i> guess,” sneered
Richards, nastily.</p>

<p>The scales swayed down on the Carrington
side.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade’s code did not permit his
guests to be insulted by his subordinates.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Carrington, you leave
us no option when you take that stand,”
he said, suavely. “Whenever your man
is ready, then.”</p>

<p>“I think he is still at the house with
my father,” said young Carrington, unsteadily.
“I can telephone from the station
here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade looked out of the window.
Beside Carrington’s trap stood the landau
of yesterday. “If you will drive
home and bring your man over, we will
go directly to the mine with Mr. Richards,”
he said.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Young Carrington, bursting in upon
his father and Trevanion, told it all in
a breath.</p>

<p>Trevanion rose with the last word.</p>

<p>“The sooner I’m there the better,” he
said, phlegmatically.</p>

<p>“It’s queer business,” said John Carrington,
frowning. “Keep your eyes
open. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when I come up,” said
Trevanion. “If I don’t come up, you’ll
look after my boy?”</p>

<p>John Carrington nodded.</p>

<p>“Keep close to young Hastings,” he
said, tersely. “Don’t let Richards get
behind you alone. I’m inclined to think,
though, that the whole thing will be a
farce. He’ll take you into a few levels
where there couldn’t be any question,
and that will be all. Wade and his
nephew won’t know. And that will be
all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you over,” said Ned. His
eyes were bright with excitement.</p>

<p>Trevanion grinned as he settled himself
in the trap.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get my swell ride before
I go down,” he said. “Mostly they
take ’em when they come up&mdash;in a box.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The others were waiting, garbed in
oilskins, candles in their caps&mdash;precautionary
measures which inclined Mr.
Wade to feel that there was something
wrong in the management of a mine
that was neither lighted nor heated.</p>

<p>Hastings was struggling not to chafe
under his rôle of masterly inactivity; he
comforted himself with the thought that
it was causing things to move in the
right direction, at any rate.</p>

<p>Richards’ expression was sardonic.
As Carrington had surmised, he proposed
to tire out the greenhorns by an
exhaustive progress through workings
which would be of no possible interest
to Trevanion.</p>

<p>He calculated shrewdly about how
long it would take before they would be
glad to come up. If Trevanion remained
behind them, or if he went
down without them later&mdash;Richards
shrugged his shoulders. It was easy for
a man to fall down an uncovered winze
in a strange mine. And the fall would
explain any bruises.</p>

<p>As they started for the cage, he
turned to young Carrington. His smile
was distinctly disagreeable.</p>

<p>“Sorry you don’t feel like coming,
too,” he said, “but you might catch cold
or get your clothes dirty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever faults there were to young
Carrington’s credit, cowardice was not
one of them. Not that foolhardiness is
not almost as reprehensible.</p>

<p>“If you’ll lend me a cap and a pair of
boots, I shall be delighted,” he answered
instantly.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Ned. You’re not in this,”
Trevanion remonstrated.</p>

<p>Young Carrington was pulling on his
cap composedly now.</p>

<p>“You’ve never been down the Star,
even. You won’t be of any use,” Trevanion
insisted. Young Carrington was
getting into an oilskin coat. Richards
had not thought he would.</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone your father,” Trevanion
declared.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go down without you while
you’re doing it,” young Carrington declared,
willfully.</p>

<p>Trevanion followed him into the cage
without more ado. But he didn’t like it.</p>

<p>As the cage dropped into the blackness
of the shaft, Richards thought with
malicious pleasure that he would outwit
them all. Trevanion, holding it everyday
work for himself, was uneasy over
the boy; Hastings was impatient at his
own ignorance&mdash;he hated to feel so out
of his sphere; Mr. Wade, reviewing
each successive stage of the proceedings
which had placed him in his present situation,
called himself what he would
have slain any fellow man for thinking,
a silly old fool; and Carrington&mdash;ah, a
curious tangle of thoughts was young
Carrington’s brain, with a curious after-vision
of a bright blue sky.</p>

<p>Up in the big house on the hill, John
Carrington was wondering if it was not
time for Ned to come home.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is a curious experience&mdash;this going
underground for the first time.</p>

<p>The chill and the dampness, the
change in the air pressure, and the darkness&mdash;that
vague, depressing darkness,
on which the candle in your cap makes
so vague and flickering an impression
that it seems nervous and palpitant at
its own temerity in attempting so gigantic
a task.</p>

<p>Above all, and above you, as you
clearly realize, for an eighth of a mile,
perhaps, the huge impending weight of
earth and rock, against whose menace
timbering a foot and a half thick seems
like trying to bolster the basement of a
tottering St. Paul’s with matches.</p>

<p>It is like finding oneself in some gigantic
letter press, the screw of which
the hand of fate may choose to turn&mdash;perhaps
now; pressing downward with
pitiless, relentless, inanimate mechanism
until the Parchment of the World bears
the dull red mark of these unwilling witnesses
to its deed.</p>

<p>These are all terrors unconfessed.
Farthest of real menaces you find&mdash;whose
vague terror is made dormant
by the real necessities of the moment,
the constant strain of the eye to distinguish&mdash;now
to avoid the direct peril of
an uncovered winze underfoot, now to
notice how closely the “lagging” roofs
in the drift, this indefinitely long hole,
seven and a half feet square, in which
you find yourself.</p>

<p>Then comes the strain of the novice
brain to comprehend the reasons and the
logic of it all.</p>

<p>Richards showed his native shrewdness
in the way he managed the expedition.
The humor of its personnel was
quite within his comprehension. Three
men, ignorant of every detail of mining,
Trevanion of the Star, and himself.</p>

<p>It was grotesque enough for comedy.</p>

<p>And, too, Richards had at last taken
Mr. Wade’s measure&mdash;or thought he
had.</p>

<p>“You have to sling softsoap to suit
the pig-headed old sissy,” he phrased it.</p>

<p>And he assumed a bluff heartiness
which actually became genuine at times,
as he explained carefully and clearly the
A B C’s of things.</p>

<p>For Richards loved the mine he had
made, loved it after the fashion of his
nature, with an intensity of possession.</p>

<p>Fought for it fairly when fairness
served best, and trickily when trickiness
seemed more profitable. Took a man’s
genuine pride when he had forced it to
obey him. Abused its future for the
present good if he felt like it. Slaved
for it fiercely in reprisal. It was the
only way Richards knew how to love
anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>That these two men whom the accident
of fortune had placed in actual
ownership of the mine should interfere
with him had roused first his rage, and
now his determination to placate them,
to hoodwink them. He showed a good-natured
tolerance of their ignorance,
and an indefatigable patience in explanation.</p>

<p>“That’s it; now you’re catching on
fine,” he encouraged them, as they
grasped some elemental principle of
mining. He led them over a good deal
of ground during these explanations.
He piloted them with a rough carefulness
which even included young Carrington.
The boy’s being there at all
amused him rather than otherwise. But
Trevanion was guarding young Carrington
with as wary an eye as he was
watching Richards.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade decided that for the first
time Richards was appearing to advantage.</p>

<p>Aboveground his crudities of manner
might be repellent; here he was in his
native element, shrewd, practical and
zealous.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade began to feel that Trevanion
the Taciturn was quite as likely
to prove the villain of the piece.</p>

<p>To be sure, it appeared that they had
embarked on a tremendous undertaking.
Mr. Wade felt that the mine was larger
than he had supposed, but, as Richards
said, they might as well understand it
thoroughly. On this Mr. Wade, with
legs that threatened to drop from his
hip sockets, plodded on.</p>

<p>Young Carrington turned white more
than once, but shut his teeth and went
on defiantly; and Hastings owned to
himself that he was desperately tired.
Trevanion was as unwearied as Cornish
patience, but Richards was not trying to
tired out Trevanion&mdash;physically.</p>

<p>It lacked five minutes of the noon
hour when they saw the cage ahead of
them, waiting at this, the seventh and
lowest, working level of the mine.</p>

<p>Below, as Richard told them, was the
development level, to which the cage did
not descend.</p>

<p>“We can’t go down now,” he said,
looking at his watch. “They’re just going
to blast, and it will take an hour
afterward for the smoke to clear. We’ll
go up and have our dinner, and come
down again this afternoon to finish up,
eh?”</p>

<p>Lunch, up on the earth’s surface, with
sunshine and first grade air. The words
were as welcome to Mr. Wade as
though an archangel had spoken them.</p>

<p>Young Carrington, too, shared his
feeling; shared, too, though unknowingly,
Mr. Wade’s calculation that his
legs would just about carry him to the
cage.</p>

<p>Richards, with an inward grin, assured
himself that those two, at least,
would attempt no afternoon expedition.</p>

<p>This farce of investigation would
soon be ended. It would be quite safe
to urge them to come down again. They
had had quite enough. He looked forward
with amused anticipation to making
the suggestion after lunch.</p>

<p>Trevanion hesitated about declaring
an intention to remain without the others
through the noon hour. No, he
would see young Carrington safely out
of it first; <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>They were almost at the cage now.</p>

<p>Richards was showing them the bell
at the side of the shaft, the signal to
the engineer to hoist the cage.</p>

<p>“All the men but one get in,” he explained.
“He touches the bell and races
across to get in the cage. The engineer
allows him so many seconds to make it.
No, you can’t stop it after it starts.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade, who had arrived at that
stage when he recked not how the cage
went up, as long as it went, continued
an unlistening way to that haven.</p>

<p>There was a detonation from the development
level.</p>

<p>“Blast,” said Richards, to young Carrington’s
look. “They’re in rather dangerous
ground, and so we have them
leave it until just before the noon hour,
in case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A man shot up from the ladder-way.
Another. And another. The ladder-hole
spouted them out like a volcano.</p>

<p>They ran toward the cage panic-stricken,
sweeping Mr. Wade into it before
them. With an instant comprehension
of the disaster that placed them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
in a common peril, Richards turned
swiftly to the others.</p>

<p>“Get in!” he shouted. “They’ve
struck water!”</p>

<p>He caught Hastings by the arm, and
rammed his way through the press like
a great machine.</p>

<p>“You &mdash;&mdash; fools! There’s plenty of
time!” he railed at his men.</p>

<p>Trevanion, guarding young Carrington
with his right arm, thrust his mighty
bulk through the struggling mass just
behind Richards.</p>

<p>They were almost at the cage door
when a terrorized Finn fought his way
past them, striking out blindly at everything
in reach.</p>

<p>One elbow thrust sent young Carrington
spinning from Trevanion’s protecting
arm to the ground, and the next
instant the Finn dropped his full weight
between Richards and Hastings, and
leaped past them into the cage.</p>

<p>He shouted triumphantly to his fellows.
It was jargon to Mr. Wade. But
Richards knew, and raged, and the other
miners knew, and rejoiced, that he had
given the signal to hoist. Trevanion was
lifting young Carrington in his arms.</p>

<p>Richards stepped into the cage, with
an oath.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, fiercely, to Hastings,
jamming a few inches of space free in
the cage with his bulk. “Room for one.
You haven’t a second to lose!” he
shouted.</p>

<p>Hastings put his hands in his pockets,
coolly.</p>

<p>“I stay with my guests,” he said. And
with his first word, the cage started upward.</p>

<p>As he turned toward the others, Trevanion,
one arm round young Carrington,
caught hold of his sleeve.</p>

<p>“We maun run for it!” he shouted.</p>

<p>For out of the great black hole beneath
them rose the water, spreading
across the bottom of the shaft.</p>

<p>From above, and suddenly faint,
they could hear Mr. Wade calling that
they must stop, that they must go back
for his nephew, and his voice was the
voice of a very old man. Trevanion instinctively
led them running back into
the drift. Young Carrington wrenched
himself free. “I’m all right,” he said.
“Took the breath out of me for a minute.
I won’t hinder.”</p>

<p>Back of them the water followed silently,
gaining gradually up the grade
of the drift.</p>

<p>“Not time to make that first rise&mdash;the
one we came down,” Trevanion said, as
they sped along. “Ought to be another&mdash;here
it is!”</p>

<p>He swerved into a black air shaft, but
swept them back into the drift the next
instant.</p>

<p>“No ladder. Stripped!” he said, laconically,
and on they hurried again.</p>

<p>The water was a thin encroaching line
thirty feet back now. Now the rise in
the level hid it from sight.</p>

<p>And finally another rise. Stripped.</p>

<p>And on again.</p>

<p>Young Carrington was getting tired.
Even peril was losing its spur. He
stumbled a little.</p>

<p>Trevanion caught him round the
waist, lifting him along with a strong
gentleness; looking at him with curiously
wondering eyes, but eyes that
never lost their look of fealty.</p>

<p>“Why are the ladders gone?” young
Carrington asked, and he kept his voice
resolutely free from fear.</p>

<p>“Economy,” said Trevanion, briefly.
“Wanted to use them somewhere else.
We’ll find one after a bit.” Which
might or might not be so.</p>

<p>“And if we don’t?” said Hastings,
swinging alongside.</p>

<p>“They’ll send the cage to the level
above, and your men will be hallooing
all over the place for us,” Trevanion
told him. He thought with a certain
grim humor that Richards would not
make any wild exertion to save him.
Hastings’ presence was their best hope,
if the ladders failed.</p>

<p>“If it should take them a long time
to find us?” It was young Carrington
now.</p>

<p>“Water may stop altogether,” Trevanion
stated. “Depends on the size of the
vug. Anyway, it rises slower the more
ground it covers. We’ll have time
enough.” But no one could tell that.</p>

<p>Disappointment. Hope. Then the
end of the drift stared them in the face&mdash;rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and dirt as a final blast had left
it.</p>

<p>But “Here’s our raise,” said Trevanion,
bluffly, turning off.</p>

<p>And the raise was ladderless: a vertical
opening, whose hard rock walls
were too slippery for even a Cornishman
to climb. Trapped!</p>

<p>They looked at the place where the
ladder should have been, as though it
must, perforce, appear. Young Carrington
ran a finger rapidly round inside
his collar, as though it had grown
suddenly tight. The air seemed close.
Then he pulled himself together sharply.
Say what you will, blood will tell.</p>

<p>“And now what?” he asked Trevanion,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Hastings’ eyes were looking the same
question.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Trevanion, stoically.</p>

<p>To wait, inactive: it is the real test of
courage.</p>

<p>With any kind of activity, hope plays
an obligato; but when there is no struggle
to be made, fears tries a tremolo
first on one heartstring and then another.</p>

<p>“You should have gone with the others,”
said young Carrington to Hastings,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Never!” said Hastings, decidedly.
“There’s that drop of comfort in the
whole thing, anyway.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose I should feel,”
he flashed, “if I were safe on the surface,
and you were here? I should feel
as though I had decoyed you into it.”
He turned to Trevanion. “Can’t the
pumps get the water under control?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“If you had enough of ’em,” said Trevanion.
“That’s another place where
Richards economized. The Star’ll pump
it out for you after a while.”</p>

<p>“Richards will have his day of reckoning
if I get out of this,” said Hastings,
furiously.</p>

<p>“Does he know that?” asked Trevanion,
dryly.</p>

<p>And Hastings saw the point. So did
young Carrington. The cards were
Richards’ now, to play as he chose.
Hastings turned to his friends.</p>

<p>“Ned,” he said, “I’m mighty sorry.
Sorry I interfered at all. I’d give my
life to have you and Trevanion safe on
the surface.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me,” said the lad,
quickly.</p>

<p>Trevanion’s eyes watched him curiously.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you about Elenore,”
Hastings went on, quietly. “I
suppose you know that I love Elenore,
Ned?”</p>

<p>Trevanion stepped back a few paces,
but he listened intently.</p>

<p>“Do you?” said the lad, simply.</p>

<p>“Do I?” said Hastings, impetuously.
“The hardest thing I ever did was to
leave her without telling her I loved her.
But you can’t ask a girl like that to wait
indefinitely, you know. Then, when I
found out where I was coming, it
seemed as though it might have been
meant, after all. And I wanted to patch
up the trouble between the mines, so
that I’d have at least a fair chance.”</p>

<p>“And then?” said young Carrington,
softly.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Hastings, recklessly, “I
hoped&mdash;I was daft enough to dream&mdash;that
she might not think it a hardship to
come back to the little place where she
was born&mdash;to her father&mdash;to me. To
<i>me</i>! And when I talked of building a
bungalow, I thought what it would
mean to bring my wife home to it.”</p>

<p>There was silence. Then Hastings
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I may not have the chance to tell Elenore,”
he said, bruskly, half-ashamed
of the emotion he had displayed. “It’s
not quite the same thing to tell you,
old man. I’m afraid there’s small
chance of our ever being brothers-in-law,
but you wouldn’t have objected to
me as a brother, would you?”</p>

<p>“Whatever Elenore wished, I should
have wished,” the lad said, calmly.</p>

<p>Hastings laughed a short, impatient
laugh.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re all egoists,” he said.
“But I don’t mind confessing to you
that it would be easier to face the music
if I knew what Elenore <i>did</i> wish&mdash;whether
<i>she</i> cared.”</p>

<p>There was silence again. Trevanion’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
figure in the background grew tense.
Then the lad laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“You hadn’t asked her, you know,”
he said, “and Elenore isn’t the kind of a
girl to wear her heart on her sleeve. But
I know Elenore pretty well, and I think
she cared&mdash;really.”</p>

<p>Hastings flung his arm in front of his
face with a gesture that was almost boyish.</p>

<p>“Elenore!” he whispered to the cold
comfort of his coat sleeve. For virile
youth loves strongly, humanly.</p>

<p>Young Carrington’s eyes watched
him with a wonderful light. Even the
flickering candlelight showed Trevanion
that.</p>

<p>Then Hastings rammed his hands in
his pockets and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, she’s on the other
side of the ocean! It will be easier for
her, after all. Harder to realize,” he
said, fervently.</p>

<p>Young Carrington drew a quick
breath, a breath of relief. “I thought
you’d feel that way,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Trevanion stepped out into the drift.</p>

<p>“I want to speak with you a bit,” he
nodded to young Carrington.</p>

<p>The lad followed him. Hastings, left
alone, gave himself up to thoughts of
Elenore. The other side of the rock
wall, young Carrington faced Trevanion,
and knew that he knew. Every
detail of their surroundings stood out
in the light of that, with sudden distinctness.
The great timbers that walled in
the drift, the flickering light of the candles
in their caps&mdash;all seemed but the
setting for Trevanion’s eyes. The hand
he laid on young Carrington’s arm was
almost reverential in its touch.</p>

<p>“I’ve held you in my arms to-day
twice,” he said, hurriedly. “I don’t understand
why it’s you, but it’s all right.”
He looked at young Carrington as one
of Jeanne d’Arc’s soldiers might have
looked.</p>

<p>Young Carrington faced him very
quietly.</p>

<p>“I thought ’twas queer, the way you
held the child that time,” Trevanion
went on. “And you ride just as you
did as a youngster. Will he come back
now if&mdash;&mdash;” he demanded.</p>

<p>Young Carrington nodded gently.
“Yes, and he’s a splendid fellow.” If
the young voice broke for a second, that
was all. “He’ll help dad to bear it. It
was best for me to come. Best, above
all, if this was to happen.” The voice
was steady now. “I’m sorry you know,
but it would have been safe with you,
anyway.”</p>

<p>It was that same confident charm that
had conquered Trevanion at the outset.</p>

<p>“You won’t tell <i>him</i>?” he questioned,
jerking his head toward the raise.</p>

<p>Young Carrington’s head shook a
slow negative.</p>

<p>“Not unless at the very last I turn
weak and womanish;” and there was a
whimsical touch in the last word.</p>

<p>Then the young figure straightened
up with a quick decision.</p>

<p>“And I really think, Trevanion”&mdash;young
Carrington’s voice was light now&mdash;“that
I shall make a nice, plucky,
manly finish.”</p>

<p>Trevanion, following back into the
raise, would have cut his heart out to
save that buoyant young life, but his
devotion was the pure fealty of a serf
for his sovereign.</p>

<p>They played at bravery after that,
each abetting the other.</p>

<p>Young Carrington coaxed Trevanion
into telling them mining stories, wheedled
Hastings into all kinds of reminiscences
of his boyhood, assumed their
ultimate escape so confidently that Hastings
thought it a genuine hopefulness.</p>

<p>Not so Trevanion. He knew what
the spring was that moved young Carrington
to play up to a buoyant part.
And he helped, with anecdotes of wonderful
rescues, of escapes just in the
nick of time.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of one of the
best of these when a little lapping sound
stopped him.</p>

<p>A thin little line of water pulsed
gently into the entrance of the raise.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Mr. Wade had shouted his fruitless
commands, in the ascending cage, all
the way to the surface, raging at Richards
and his management, and unconvinced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
in spite of a united and profane
assurance, of his inability to stop the
cage and go back; furious at him for
having installed such a defective system,
and threatening him with dismissal
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>His nephew and his nephew’s friend
left to danger, while these brutes were
being brought to the surface! He had
never suffered such helpless frenzy in
all his neatly adjusted life.</p>

<p>At the surface the cage cleared with
magical suddenness. Mr. Wade, breathless
with rage, was fairly dragged out
by Richards, and in so short a time as a
signal may be given and obeyed, the
cage had again started downward.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade leaned back against the
timbers of the shaft house, with the exhaustion
of relief.</p>

<p>But it was a relief that Richards did
not share. This particular kind of disaster
was so frequently recurrent that he
knew its possibilities all too well. And
he raged that it should have come just
now. It was such a routine danger that
he had not thought of it as a special
menace in taking them down. Casualty,
with Mr. Wade involved or witnessing,
had been furthest from his thoughts or
desires.</p>

<p>“How long before they will be up?”’
Mr. Wade asked, faintly.</p>

<p>Richards, tensely alert, made no answer.
The cage had reached the bottom
of the shaft now. He waited a minute&mdash;two&mdash;three.
There was no sign from
below. He himself gave the signal to
hoist.</p>

<p>“Are they coming?” demanded Mr.
Wade.</p>

<p>Richards shook his head. “I can’t
say, sir,” he said, “but they’ve had plenty
of time. Either they got in the cage and
forgot to give the signal”&mdash;and with
Trevanion below this was an unlikely
contingency&mdash;“or&mdash;&mdash;” he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Or?” said Mr. Wade, sharply.</p>

<p>“Or the water has cut them off,”
Richards finished.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;&mdash;” said Mr. Wade, faintly.</p>

<p>“Reach ’em from the level above,”
Richards answered. But he thought of
certain contingencies&mdash;thought of a
good many important things.</p>

<p>There was a crowd of miners now,
watching for the cage to appear. The
jargon of Finnish comment sounded to
Mr. Wade like the buzzing of bees.
Then the cage came in sight. Empty
and dripping wet.</p>

<p>The next second everything was action,
and Richards its mainspring. His
orders pelted down like hailstones. Men,
tools, paraphernalia, filled the cage.
Other men went racing off on surface
errands.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade, paralyzed by his complete
ignorance of conditions or remedies,
seemed crushed under the consciousness
of casualty. Richards caught him by the
arm and shook him into attention.</p>

<p>“We’ll bring them up, if they are
alive,” he shouted to him, as though
he were deaf.</p>

<p>Then he stepped into the cage, and
down it went again. Mr. Wade leaned
back against the wall, motionless, his
eyes fixed on the hole where it had disappeared.</p>

<p>But over all the little town the news
was spreading like wildfire.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>John Carrington had spent a horrible
morning. When the trap came back,
and the stable boy Ike, who was driving,
announced that Mr. Ned had sent
him home, John Carrington promptly
demanded why.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said the boy. “He said,
‘That’s all,’ so I come.”</p>

<p>It couldn’t be possible that Ned had
gone down the Tray-Spot! Ned, who
had never shown the slightest eagerness
to go down the Star. But what&mdash;&mdash; And
<span class="locked">why&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>John Carrington fumed, fretted and
finally telephoned&mdash;to find to his consternation
that Ned was underground.
What under heavens had Trevanion
been thinking of, to let him go? John
Carrington raged at him. And what
was Ned thinking of? He knew absolutely
nothing of underground conditions.
Had Richards decoyed him into
it for some reason? Any reason of
Richards was not a good one.</p>

<p>John Carrington hobbled along on his
crutch from the divan on the veranda to
the couch in his bedroom, and back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
again, in a nervous unrest which made
all places equally distasteful to him.</p>

<p>He raged at his own stupidity in letting
Ned drive Trevanion over. He
raged at this miserable leg of his that
had held him prisoner so long. He
raged at the strength which came back
so slowly.</p>

<p>He sent Mrs. Kipley, who came up to
remonstrate with him on this exhausting
promenade, back to her kitchen in
short order.</p>

<p>“He’s fairly beside himself, worrying
over Mr. Ned, who ought to have had
more sense than to do such a thing, anyway,”
she scolded to Hemmy, feeling
that she must vent her own nervousness
in wrath upon some one. “Now what’s
the matter with you?” she demanded,
exasperatedly, for Hemmy’s face was
assuming a chalk color.</p>

<p>“To think that <i>he</i> may be in danger!”
said Hemmy, with a gulp.</p>

<p>“The only danger you need to worry
about is spoiling those doughnuts,” said
Mrs. Kipley, severely.</p>

<p>And Hemmy, condemned for the next
half hour to drop little doughy circles
in boiling lard, wondered, as she choked
back a sob, why even the luxury of
grief was denied her.</p>

<p>Carrington found solitude fast becoming
unbearable.</p>

<p>He sent for Mrs. Kipley. He ordered
her to tell Kipley to have the trap over
at the Tray-Spot, and when Ned came
up at the noon hour, to tell him he was
needed at home at once.</p>

<p>Kipley had no sooner started than
Carrington thought of the lad’s dignity.
He would not make a baby of him. He
dispatched Ike on Ned’s saddle horse, to
tell Kipley to place himself at Mr.
Wade’s disposal, to tell Ned to bring
Hastings and Mr. Wade back to luncheon,
if he chose; but to telephone him
at once from the mine in any case.</p>

<p>He hobbled out on the veranda to
wait for noon. He told himself that he
was getting to be an old woman; that
Ned was young and strong, and able to
take care of himself anywhere; that
Trevanion would keep his eyes open for
any deviltry on Richards’ part; that
Richards would look after any party
which contained Mr. Wade and Hastings.</p>

<p>Then the sound of galloping hoofs
came ominously. Ike, fairly hanging on
the Colonel’s neck, came flying homeward.</p>

<p>Disaster was stamped on his terrorized
face.</p>

<p>Carrington swung up on his crutch
as the boy ran stumblingly up the walk.</p>

<p>The clatter brought Mrs. Kipley and
Hemmy to the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Carrington called,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Water!” the boy choked. “The
Tray-Spot is flooded, and they’re down
there.”</p>

<p>“Who’s down there?” Carrington’s
words cut.</p>

<p>“The young fellow&mdash;Trevanion&mdash;and
Mr. Ned,” Ike sobbed.</p>

<p>Carrington’s ashy face worked curiously.</p>

<p>“And Richards?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Come up and left ’em,” moaned the
boy.</p>

<p>John Carrington wheeled, strode limpingly,
and for the first time without a
crutch, into the house, snatched something
that glistened from the drawer of
his desk, and came running rapidly in
that uneven, limping way toward the
saddled horse.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, what are you going
to do?” Mrs. Kipley called out, as he
managed, by the aid of the horse block,
to get into the saddle.</p>

<p>The face that turned toward her was
distorted with fury, but the twisting lips
spoke only two words in a hoarsely guttural
cry: “My boy!” But in them was
anguish and revenge.</p>

<p>The Colonel shot forward like a shell
from a gun.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Kipley, mingling with the crowd
around the shaft house, picking up every
shred of information heavy-heartedly,
saw with consternation the bulky figure
pounding toward them on the Colonel.
He was beside the horse’s head when
John Carrington drew rein.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone down for ’em,” he
said, swiftly, and his voice was weighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with pity: “They’re going to get ’em
on the level above.”</p>

<p>John Carrington gave no sign of hearing
him. He was trying to dismount.</p>

<p>“Give me your shoulder,” he said,
sharply. “This cursed leg&mdash;&mdash;” He
groaned as he came awkwardly and
heavily to the ground. Then, steadying
himself by Kipley’s shoulder, he hurried
in that lunging, uneven way to the
shaft.</p>

<p>He had flung the bridle automatically
over the Colonel’s head, and that sagacious
animal, well trained as a cavalry
horse, stood motionless, waiting.</p>

<p>Kipley told all he had learned of the
story, tersely, as he steadied him along.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade, waiting numbly by the
shaft, found himself confronted by two
men.</p>

<p>“You,” said a deep voice, strangling
with rage, “came up and left my son.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade raised his tired eyes to
meet John Carrington’s bloodshot ones.</p>

<p>“They,” said Mr. Wade, mechanically,
“came up and left my nephew.”</p>

<p>Then the consciousness of who this
man was, and what Hastings had done,
awoke in him a sense of pride of blood
which restored him in voice and bearing
to some semblance of himself.</p>

<p>“My nephew,” he repeated, with a
touch of arrogance, “who refused to
save himself and leave your son and
your workman.” He straightened himself
up with a dignity whose assumed
calm hardly covered its pathos.</p>

<p>“As he would, naturally,” he finished.</p>

<p>John Carrington’s eyes softened.</p>

<p>“I thought he was that kind,” he said.
“I like him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade’s heart warmed to a man
who appreciated his nephew.</p>

<p>“Then my son would have done the
same thing for him, in his place,” John
Carrington added, proudly.</p>

<p>Young Carrington was a splendid
young fellow, Mr. Wade thought. His
sympathy swept out to his father.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” he said. And the
two men’s hands met.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wade spoke again, it was
with a feeling of placing reliance in
John Carrington.</p>

<p>“Are they doing all they can?” he
said, simply. “You ought to know.”</p>

<p>Carrington’s mind swept like a microscope
over the details of the rescuers’
plans, as Kipley had given them to him.
“Tell me your side of it,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade told him mechanically.</p>

<p>Carrington pondered it.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to think they are,” he
said, at last.</p>

<p>For the conviction forced itself upon
him that Richards would do his best to
rescue Hastings. And if there was
safety underground, Trevanion would
find it. Time was the uncertain factor.
If there was time!</p>

<p>Kipley brought a rough bench, and
the two men sat down.</p>

<p>If there was silence between them,
there was also the bond of a common
anxiety.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From the moment Richards had seen
the three men left on the seventh level
he had seen several other things clearly.</p>

<p>One was that it would be no longer
possible to parry the question of pumping
apparatus with Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>Another was that the only thing
which could make the possibility of his
continuing as manager of the Tray-Spot
worth a straw was the quick, well-planned
rescue of the three men. In the
reaction of relief from casualty, resourcefulness
now might plead for him.</p>

<p>And the last was that if Trevanion
did not have time to get them up the
first raise, they were caught in some
one of those other raises, from which
he had had the ladders removed only the
week before.</p>

<p>Everything depended on the progress
the three had been able to make, and
the rapidity with which the water was
coming.</p>

<p>When the cage dropped to the sixth
level, Richards knew from its solitude
that they had not been able to make the
first raise, and Richards’ men understood
that they were to do their best.</p>

<p>They ran to the second, calling down
as they uncovered it: no answer. And
the third: to hear only the hollow reverberation
of their own voices; to see by
the light of a falling candle the glint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
water in the bottom. And the fourth:
Richards himself, hurrying along in advance
of his men toward the final raise
to the south, acknowledged that this was
a last and very slender hope.</p>

<p>As he hallooed down the raise the answering
cry came back as swiftly to his
ears as the sight of the three twinkling
lights to his eyes. If the candle in his
cap was a star of safety to them, those
three lights were relief to him.</p>

<p>With swift brevity he ordered the ladders,
then called down: “We’ll have
you up, all right.”</p>

<p>And up the blackness came Hastings’
voice: “Hurry, for God’s sake; it’s ankle
deep!”</p>

<p>The first ladder dropped swiftly to
the position, to be nailed in place by the
fastest man the Tray-Spot had. Three
minutes. The second one sped down
after it. Men stood by with ropes, if
ladders should prove too slow.</p>

<p>Seven minutes, and the third ladder
started down. This was rapid work, but
the ropes slid down, as well. The fourth
ladder touched the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>The water was at their knees when
they saw it come. Trevanion had begun
to knot a rope around young Carrington’s
waist. He flung it off now, to
swing the slight young figure to his
shoulders, to set the stiff feet firmly on
the ladder. “I maun take him! ’E
can’t do it alone!” he said to Hastings,
as he swung himself up after the lad,
supporting him.</p>

<p>And it was, in truth, fidelity to young
Carrington, not hurry to save himself
before Hastings. Nor did Hastings misunderstand.
He would have gone last,
anyway.</p>

<p>But it seemed a long way to the top.
He was terribly stiff and wet and chilled,
grateful to the strong hands that lifted
him out at last.</p>

<p>He saw Trevanion ahead, half carrying
Ned, refusing to let anyone else
touch the lad.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he followed
more because he was led along than because
of any will of his own. They
were in the cage now, going up, and the
cheers of the miners with them rose before
them.</p>

<p>It would mean but one thing to those
on the surface; a thing that made two
haggard-faced, gray-headed men stand
shaken with emotion as the cage came
in sight.</p>

<p>To Mr. Wade the other faces were
but a blur around Hastings; to Carrington
nothing was clear but his son’s
face, chilled blue-white, as the lad
leaned in utter weariness against Trevanion.</p>

<p>Neither man saw Richards, nor heard
his bluff “All safe!” But the waiting
crowd, heedless of old animosities for
the moment, took up the cheer. It
served as chorus when John Carrington,
catching Ned’s icy hands in his,
said, hoarsely: “Thank God!”&mdash;when
the lad, striving to smile his wonted
brave smile, answered: “I do, dad;”
when Trevanion, crying: “’E must
keep movin’!” swept young Carrington
along to where the Colonel stood patiently
waiting, and, lifting him into the
saddle, held him with one hand as he
ran alongside, urging the animal into a
gentle trot; when John Carrington, impatient
to follow, and turning for Kipley’s
shoulder to steady him, saw Mr.
Wade, his face pinched with suspense
and fatigue, resting rather heavily on
Hastings’ arm, saw Hastings, gray-drab
with fag, looking about for a vehicle of
some sort.</p>

<p>If John Carrington’s heartstrings
pulled tenaciously toward home, it was
not visible in the cordial insistence with
which he drove Hastings and Mr. Wade
to their car.</p>

<p>“I count on you both for lunch tomorrow,”
he called, as he left them at
that haven of refuge.</p>

<p>Then he gripped Kipley’s arm.</p>

<p>“Drive like the devil!” he whispered,
hoarsely.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The ride had shaken the chill from
young Carrington’s blood, but Trevanion
refused to leave him until he saw
him safely in the house.</p>

<p>At the door young Carrington turned
and laid his hand lightly and firmly on
Trevanion’s arm.</p>

<p>“You’re splendid, Trevanion,” he
said, gently; “I shan’t forget.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>And Trevanion, turning away, would
have given his heart’s blood for just
that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kipley bore down upon them,
bustlingly energetic, a glass of whisky
in one hand and a telegram in the other.
Hemmy, red-eyed, lingered in the offing.</p>

<p>Young Carrington tossed off the
whisky, tore open the envelope, and,
calling to Trevanion, who was halfway
down the steps, sped to him and spoke
low and rapidly.</p>

<p>Trevanion nodded. Young Carrington,
coming back, was smiling rather
tremulously.</p>

<p>“Not a thing, thanks,” he said, to
Mrs. Kipley’s offer of assistance. “All
I need is a bath and a rest. In the
morning I shall be quite&mdash;myself.”</p>

<p>He laughed an odd, gay little laugh.</p>

<p>“You don’t feel any bone ache?” said
Mrs. Kipley, anxiously, as he went up
the stairs.</p>

<p>Young Carrington looked down gleefully.</p>

<p>“I feel&mdash;relieved,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” said Mrs. Kipley,
to Hemmy, who was altering a determination
to enter a convent into a desire
to be a trained nurse.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Kipley and young Carrington
were not thinking of the same predicament.</p>

<p>For the telegram read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Shall arrive Yellow Dog nine to-night;
your trunk with me.</p>

<p class="p0 in14">
<span class="smcap">E. Carrington.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>John Carrington, his abused leg
stretched out on a chair in front of him,
was smoking a final cigar for the night,
in the big downstairs bedroom.</p>

<p>He was resting one elbow on his
desk; and the head that leaned upon his
hand was full of plans for his son’s future.
He was safe upstairs, thank God!
He was snug in bed and sleeping when
his father got home. And he left him
to sleep off his fatigue, though he was
impatient to talk with him.</p>

<p>The clock over the fireplace chimed
the half hour after nine. There was
the sound of quick steps on the veranda,
then in the hall. A murmur of
voices. One was Trevanion’s. “The
room at the head of the hall,” he heard
his undertone. Some one ran up the
stairs, and some one closed the hall door
gently and went down the steps.</p>

<p>John Carrington was out in the hall
the next instant. He heard the door of
Ned’s room open. He stumped up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Light came through a half-opened
door. A murmur of voices and laughing
greeting came to him.</p>

<p>Ned, fully dressed, as though he were
the newcomer, had his arms around
some one who was sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>“Dear old girl! What a brick you
are!” Carrington heard Ned say. “Trevanion
told me.”</p>

<p>“Ned!” he cried, uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>The boy swung round joyously.</p>

<p>“Dad!” he shouted, and there was
glad greeting in his tone. “You bully
old dad!”</p>

<p>He caught his father by the hand and
shoulder with both his hands, but John
Carrington held him off mechanically.</p>

<p>For the figure sitting up in bed,
flushed, mischievous and laughing at his
bewilderment, was Ned!</p>

<p>The hands that grasped John Carrington’s
arm and shoulder gripped
him, shook him slightly.</p>

<p>“She’s been ripping, perfectly ripping,
dad, and I’m four months late, but be a
little glad to see me,” this Ned’s laughing
voice went on.</p>

<p>“She&mdash;&mdash;” John Carrington stammered.</p>

<p>Ned waved a genial hand toward the
figure in the bed.</p>

<p>“Miss Elenore Carrington, the most
successful self-made man in history!”
he announced, with a flourish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>When Miss Elenore Carrington
opened her eyes the following morning,
it was to gaze contentedly from her bed
at a large, square, hotel-placarded object
in the center of her room.</p>

<p>Objectively, it was merely an uncommonly
good-sized trunk, but subjectively,
it stood for Femininity, sweetly
personal and newly reincarnated.</p>

<p>“But what do you suppose he put in?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
murmured Miss Carrington. And uncertainty
became unbearable.</p>

<p>She shook her fist gayly at a masculine-looking
bathrobe hanging over the
back of a chair. “I won’t put you on
again, even to <i>look</i>!” she announced,
with a gayly menacing flourish.</p>

<p>She caught the coverings of the bed
around her, and was out in a great
white splash on the floor, fumbling
with the key in the lock.</p>

<p>The trunk lid flew open, and she
knelt, looking like a boyish little novice,
in the plain white night garment, with
the big splash of white spreading all
over the floor about her.</p>

<p>She had that floor strewn with her
treasures. Lovely frilly feminine garments,
dainty slippers all buckle and
heel, dear little everyday frocks and
lingerie blouses, and gowns for occasions
in the big trays beneath. She
laughed and blessed Ned as she delved
down.</p>

<p>And hats&mdash;actually all her hats! But
alack-a-day! She clutched her shorn
locks with a grimace. And that square
package&mdash;toilet things; useless hairpins
and unusable jeweled shell combs;
and here, in tissue paper&mdash;oh, the forethought
of Ned!&mdash;the very locks of
hair of which she had shorn herself so
recklessly, bound together by the hairdresser’s
skill into a lustrous coil that
had distinct possibilities.</p>

<p>She looked at it with an admiration
such as she had never felt when it was
growing on her own head.</p>

<p>She swathed herself in the laciest and
swirliest of pale blue silk negligées, and
sped to the mirror to experiment.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>An hour later. Miss Elenore Carrington,
daintily fresh as a morning-glory,
brown hair coiled closely at the back of
her head and pompadoured loosely
around a face worthy of its best efforts;
garbed in a fetching little morning
frock of white linen elaborately
embroidered, and short enough to permit
the eye of man to rejoice over the
well-shaped <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaussure</i> which supported
a high-arched instep in a deliciously
restful way&mdash;Miss Carrington, in short,
not only in her right mind but in her
right clothes, stood looking out of her
window at a world glowing with the
glory of the September sun.</p>

<p>Her lips curved smilingly as she
thought of many things: of her father’s
surprise the night before, of the long,
long talk and the flood of explanations
which had lasted far into the night,
and brought them into a completeness
of understanding which had meant
happiness to them all.</p>

<p>Ned had told them what those
months in the East had done for him,
not only in technique but in inspiration;
how, returning to Paris, he
found that his salon portrait had
brought him a commission to paint a
certain crown prince that coming winter;
how Velantour, pleased as he was
himself, had shouted “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Déjà!</i>”&mdash;a much
prettier “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjà</i>” than the famous one&mdash;and
had added: “Now you will paint
his soul in his face, his responsibilities
in his clothes, and his destiny in the
background.”</p>

<p>How, too, returning to Paris, he had
found Elenore’s letters, telling him that
things were going on successfully in her
imposture; and how, getting her things
together as hastily as possible, he had
come to relieve her on the fastest greyhound
afloat, determining remorsefully
to give up even the crown prince if his
father needed him.</p>

<p>Needed him! John Carrington was
so proud of his talent that he would
have cut off his right hand before he
would have kept him.</p>

<p>Then they had discussed the exigencies
of the present; how the thing was
to be played out. Elenore insisted that
no one should know; Ned that everyone
should; he wanted no more credit
that didn’t belong to him. John Carrington,
considering it the cleverest
thing that had ever happened, would
have blazoned it on the stars.</p>

<p>They compromised: first, that the
Kipleys should be told, a plan which
had everything in its favor; second, that
Hastings and Mr. Wade should know.
This was the battleground.</p>

<p>Even when Elenore had yielded the
question of Hastings, she objected
strenuously to Mr. Wade’s enlightenment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
He wouldn’t understand. But
easygoing Ned turned dogged.</p>

<p>“If you had only <i>seen</i> him, you’d
know how appalling he’d think it,” Elenore
had defended.</p>

<p>“When I see him to-morrow, I’ll
meditate on the best way to break it
to him,” Ned had retorted.</p>

<p>“But you’ll wait a little,” she coaxed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give you time to get in a
bit of work,” he conceded.</p>

<p>Miss Elenore Carrington, looking out
of the window, grew suddenly dreamy-eyed.</p>

<p>Over on the far hill, a branch of hard
maple had turned brilliantly scarlet.
But it could hardly have been its reflection
that brought the delicate stain
into Miss Carrington’s cheeks. Oddly
enough, it was on that particular hill
that Hastings had planned to build his
bungalow.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was a morning of merriment, of
buoyancy, of stupefactions.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley was fairly swamped by
the last emotion. He sat on the steps
of the side porch, and only a medical
expert could have told that his condition
was not merely comatose.</p>

<p>All that saved Mrs. Kipley was the
urgency of preparing a suitable lunch
for “those New York folks.”</p>

<p>Even then she discovered herself doing
the most remarkable things. “I’ll
bake the ice cream next,” she remarked
to Hemmy. Hemmy, used to the startling
changes of romance, adjusted herself
to the situation with apparent ease&mdash;and
a new dream of bliss.</p>

<p>For had not Mr. Ned said, jubilantly:
“Jove, this air is pure ozone! I
want to paint everything in sight. You,
too, Hemmy, in that pink-checked
gown.”</p>

<p>Painters fell in love with their models
sometimes.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>John Carrington fairly basked in
happiness. Only one thing troubled
him, and when he caught Elenore alone
for a moment that came out. He took
her hands in his and looked into her
blue eyes lovingly.</p>

<p>“I told you once,” he said, gently,
“that no daughter could be so dear to a
man as his son.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dad,” she said, frankly.</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>“I was wrong,” he said.</p>

<p>Then they spoke of other things.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“How is young Mr. Carrington this
morning?” said Mr. Wade, stepping
into the trap, to Mr. Kipley, driving.
“None the worse for yesterday, I
hope?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kipley’s face contorted, as
though he were about to sneeze.</p>

<p>“He’s lookin’ about the same,” he
replied, and his voice sounded muffled.
He seemed to derive such inward satisfaction
from the phrase that he repeated
it: “He’s lookin’ about the
same. I don’t think it hurt him none.”
And immediately gave his attention to
his horses.</p>

<p>John Carrington was on the veranda
to receive them.</p>

<p>“This is a gala day,” he told them, as
he grasped their hands in warm welcome.
“My other child came home last
night.”</p>

<p>Hastings’ heart leaped.</p>

<p>“Your daughter?” said Mr. Wade,
politely. And with his words Elenore
came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>She had doffed the linen gown of the
morning for the delicately elaborate one
she had last worn at that farewell tea
in Paris.</p>

<p>There was the faintest suggestion of
shyness in the gracefully smiling welcome
she gave Mr. Wade, which suited
that particular old gentleman to a T.</p>

<p>“You have every reason to be proud
of both your children,” he said, affably,
to John Carrington.</p>

<p>“I am,” John Carrington replied, and
he meant it.</p>

<p>Hastings, wordlessly happy to feel
Elenore’s hand resting lightly in his,
pressed it tenderly as he tried to look
into the eyes he had so longed to see.</p>

<p>Her long lashes veiled them distractingly.</p>

<p>Then she raised them to his with a
certain laughing mockery which was
delicious but baffling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>“Have I changed much?” she demanded,
lightly.</p>

<p>“I shall have to look a long time to
find out,” said Hastings. His voice
shook a little.</p>

<p>She laughed with sweet spontaneity.</p>

<p>“I shall not waste myself on anyone
with such a disgracefully bad memory,”
she said, with mock reproach. “I shall
devote myself to your uncle.”</p>

<p>She turned to Mr. Wade and proceeded
to make her word good.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade found himself sitting on a
broad, shady veranda, talking to as
pretty a girl as he had seen in years;
talking, as he felt with a commendable
thrill of pride, his very best. What a
listener she was! How graceful! How
super-feminine! How ready-witted!</p>

<p>She agreed with him, and Mr. Wade
felt even more agreeably conscious than
usual of his own good judgment. She
disagreed daintily. It was exhilarating
to show her where she was wrong.</p>

<p>“If I were twenty years younger!”
said Mr. Wade to himself, which was
a little more than half the number he
should have stated, but what elderly
gentleman is exactly accurate in such
statements!</p>

<p>He looked sharply at Hastings, and
something in the divided attention his
nephew was giving John Carrington
seemed to please him.</p>

<p>There was a flutter of Hemmy’s
apron in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Ned will join us in the dining
room,” said John Carrington, genially.</p>

<p>Ned was, in fact, standing on its
threshold.</p>

<p>He greeted them with gay good fellowship.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you looking so well
after yesterday,” Mr. Wade assured
him.</p>

<p>Ned flashed a frank, bright smile at
him.</p>

<p>“I’m as fresh as though yesterday
had never happened,” he said, gayly,
“and we’re going to keep conversation
on pleasanter things through luncheon,
on Elenore’s account.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade nodded. “Of course,” he
said, “we must not alarm the young
lady with what might have been.”</p>

<p>And the chatter that ensued was, in
truth, gay and bright and full of reminiscences
of the life the three young
people had enjoyed in Paris.</p>

<p>If Mr. Wade had ever tasted better
fried chicken, he had forgotten where,
and he praised it with an emphasis
that turned Mrs. Kipley, who was helping
Hemmy wait on table, a deep magenta
with suppressed pride.</p>

<p>He approved highly, too, of the
champagne cup, and when Elenore
confessed its concoction, declared gallantly
that that explained its excellence.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I imagine that you succeed
in whatever you do,” he added, as the
string to his floral bouquet.</p>

<p>They were at the coffee-and-cordial
stage of proceedings now, and Mrs.
Kipley and Hemmy had disappeared on
their laurels.</p>

<p>“She does, Mr. Wade,” said Ned,
gayly, “and she attempts appallingly
difficult things at that. Would you like
to hear about her star performance?”</p>

<p>“I would, indeed,” said Mr. Wade,
heartily.</p>

<p>And Elenore, with a look at her
brother, knew that the moment had
come.</p>

<p>“Then I shall leave you to your
cigars,” she said, lightly, pushing back
her chair, in the instinct to escape.</p>

<p>For back of the lightness, excitement,
altogether too insecurely barred, was
making a dash for liberty.</p>

<p>But Ned was on his feet as well, and
caught her firmly but lightly around the
waist as she tried to pass him.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stay and help me
out,” he said, with mock reproach.
“How do you expect a man who only
arrived last night to tell it straight?”</p>

<p>Even then they thought he must have
mis-spoken himself.</p>

<p>But Elenore turned with her hand on
his shoulder and faced them buoyantly.</p>

<p>“There was once a Rising Genius,
who had one great, glorious opportunity,”
she began. “He had, too, a sister
whom the gods hadn’t dowered with
talent of any kind; and a father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who not only fractured his leg,”
John Carrington broke in, “but got
fractious in other ways as well. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
not knowing of the opportunity, insisted
on his son’s coming home.”</p>

<p>“So the sister, who was perfectly
bully, and the pluckiest girl&mdash;&mdash;” Ned
began.</p>

<p>But Elenore interposed.</p>

<p>“He was perfectly willing to come,”
she insisted to them. “Don’t forget
that.” She slipped from his arm and
swept them the daintiest of courtesies.</p>

<p>She touched the elaborate chiffon
quillings of her skirt with daintily approving
fingers. “I never knew the
sustaining and soothing influence of
feminine attire until I was bereft of it,”
she assured them, laughingly. “I shall
be distractingly fond of frills all the
rest of my life. Wasn’t it horrid underground!”
she flashed; and they
heard the swish of her retreating skirts.</p>

<p>Hastings gripped Ned suddenly by
the arm.</p>

<p>“You weren’t down the mine with
me yesterday?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Pullman, Lower 8, from Chicago,”
said that young gentleman, serenely.</p>

<p>“Then I <i>shall</i> be your brother-in-law,”
he ejaculated, and vanished like
a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade’s expression approached
imbecility.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me&mdash;&mdash;” he began,
numbly.</p>

<p>“That I only came last night, but my
sister has been here all summer,” said
Ned, concisely.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The air came in refreshingly through
the opened windows. Elenore was
standing, one arm on the back of a
chair. She smiled slightly as Hastings
came toward her impetuously.</p>

<p>“It was quite a composite speech,
wasn’t it?” she said.</p>

<p>He covered the hand on the back of
the chair with his own.</p>

<p>“I can’t realize it,” he said. “You&mdash;all
that time.”</p>

<p>“It seemed quite a long time, too,”
she confessed.</p>

<p>“You underground!” he went on. “I
should have died of anxiety if I had
suspected it.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you dreadfully,”
she murmured. “There’s no harm in
owning now that I was afraid.”</p>

<p>The hand that held hers closed over
it more tightly.</p>

<p>“There’s no harm now,” he said,
tensely, “in telling me if you meant
what you said: that you thought Elenore
cared for me.”</p>

<p>“There’s no particular harm now,”
she parodied, daringly, with downcast
eyes, “in your telling Elenore now what
you told her then.”</p>

<p>He swept her into his arms with a
tender forcefulness. “That I love her.
Elenore! Elenore!”</p>

<p>The full red lips that his own found,
breathlessly, were mysteriously, maddeningly
sweet. And those deep blue
eyes&mdash;what marvelous things they confessed
to him!</p>

<p>“The dear little bungalow!” he whispered.
“But we needn’t wait for it,
Elenore. Marry me soon, and we’ll
build it afterward.”</p>

<p>She laughed deliciously.</p>

<p>The sound of steps in the hall came
to them, and Hastings drew her to the
vantage ground of a corner as Mr.
Wade and the Carringtons, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">père et fils</i>,
came in view outside the windows to
seat themselves comfortably in the big
veranda chairs.</p>

<p>“And,” said Mr. Wade, in high good
humor, and evidently continuing a conversation
begun at the table, “it
shouldn’t be difficult for you and your
son-in-law to arrange the management
of the two mines amicably between
you.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you getting on rather rapidly?”
John Carrington demanded, with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Not as rapidly as Laurence would
like to, I’ll wager,” Mr. Wade said, with
confidence.</p>

<p>Then he polished his eyeglasses with
his handkerchief. “I have always had
a great admiration for the heroines of
Shakespeare&mdash;<i>Rosalind</i>, in particular,”
he said, with a hint of pedantic precision;
“but I consider Miss Elenore
more charming still.”</p>

<p>“My idea, exactly,” murmured Hastings.</p>

<p>“As long as you’ve settled it all for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
them, you two,” said Ned, with confidential
raillery, “perhaps you’d better
hurry up the great event, so it can take
place before I go back to Paris. Everything
has to be sacrificed to my career,
you know.”</p>

<p>He spoke with light mockery.</p>

<p>Hastings’ arm tightened around Elenore,
and his pleading lost none of its
force because it was silent.</p>

<p>The head on his shoulder gave a sudden
gay, bewitching little nod.</p>

<p>“We consent to sacrifice ourselves,”
Hastings called, jubilantly.</p>

<p>And the sound of applause drifted
in through the open windows.</p>

<h2 class="tiny" title="Mrs. Massingbyrd Interferes" id="a48">MRS. MASSINGBYRD
INTERFERES<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>By Mary H. Vorse</i></span></h2>

<div class="b1 figcenter" style="width: 585px;">
<img src="images/i048a.png" width="585" height="224" alt="Mrs. Massingbyrd Interferes, by Mary H. Vorse" />
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/iw.png" width="124" height="122" alt="W" /></div>
<p class="drop-capw">WHAT makes the boom
go sheering up in the
air in that silly way?”
Mrs. Massingbyrd
asked me.</p>

<p>“It’s trying to
gooseneck,” I told
her. “And if you
would like me to take the tiller&mdash;&mdash;”
Now, how foolish this suggestion was, I
ought to have known.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Mrs. Massingbyrd
briskly cut me short, pulling the tiller
smartly toward her to emphasize her refusal.</p>

<p>The boat jibed, and the next thing
we were both in the water. Mrs.
Massingbyrd’s shining head came to the
surface a few feet from mine. She
shook the water from her eyes, gasped
for breath once or twice, and then with
a magnificent affectation of composure:</p>

<p>“Something told me I ought to wear
my bathing suit,” she remarked, reflectively.</p>

<p>“It was vanity told you,” I replied
with irritation. Nothing had told me I
ought to wear mine. It was just like
Lydia Massingbyrd to wear a bathing
suit to get capsized in. I’ve never
known a woman who so infallibly
landed on her feet.</p>

<p>“I think,” she continued, complacently,
as we struck out for the shore,
not far distant, “I chose a very nice
place for spilling us. I know women
who would have been capable of doing
it in the middle of Long Island
Sound!”</p>

<p>“It would have been still more considerate
if you’d chosen a spot near the
mainland to show your seamanship,”
I suggested, with polite sarcasm.</p>

<p>“I thought that all wrecks always
took place near Huckleberry Island. I
thought that was one of the things one
<i>did</i>.” Her voice was a trifle aggrieved,
she smiled at me, a smile like a
little flickering flame.</p>

<p>“She needn’t,” I thought, “try to put
the comether on me.” Suspenders are
in the way when swimming, and my
heavy, rubber-soled shoes helped to
spoil my temper.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I gloomily returned,
“our lunch is now at the bottom of the
Sound.” I knew that would fetch her.
I have never seen a woman who has so
retained a child’s unimpaired appetite.
Mrs. Massingbyrd turned an uneasy
eye on the catboat, which, buoyed by its
sail, was floating on its side like some
great, awkward, wounded bird.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd’s feet struck the
sandy beach off Huckleberry Island.</p>

<p>“But we can’t sit here all day, you
know, on a desert island, with nothing
to eat,” she remonstrated, as she made
her way to the shore. “You must do
something about it, Bobby. I call it
tragic, simply tragic, to think of all that
good lunch put out of our reach.”</p>

<p>She was by now quite on dry land,
and with great expedition pulled the
shell pins from her lovely and extraordinary
hair.</p>

<p>The jealous say that Mrs. Massingbyrd’s
strength, like Samson’s, rests
in her hair. It is that meek, silvery
gold color that usually has neither kink
nor curl, but in her case it curled riotously,
broke out at the nape of her neck
in absurd babyish ringlets and at her
temples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>“So that was why you upset us?” I
asked, irritably. “I would have taken
your word for it that it did.”</p>

<p>“Did what?” she queried, rising
promptly to the bait.</p>

<p>“Come down to your knees, I mean.”</p>

<p>“You might know that not for anything
in the world, with hair as thick
and as hard to dry as mine, would I
wet it unnecessarily!” she flashed.</p>

<p>“It’s a mercy it’s so fine,” I quoth,
maliciously, “or you would never get
it up at all.” Mrs. Massingbyrd is notoriously
vain of her wonderful hair.</p>

<p>“You might have spared yourself all
the trouble,” I continued, cuttingly, as
I took off my collar, and began on my
shoes. “It’s not nearly as nice a color
all soaked and wet; in fact, it’s rather
unpleasant and seaweedy!”</p>

<p>“Wait until it’s dry,” she triumphed,
radiantly. “You may in the end be
glad you came. But <i>I</i> won’t!” she
continued. “There’s nothing in it for
me! <i>You’re</i> not going to present a
sight for sore eyes now or at any other
portion of the day! And there’s nothing
to eat!”</p>

<p>“You’re a vain and greedy woman,
Lydia Massingbyrd,” I said, severely.
“And it would serve you right if the
lockers of Mason’s boat were empty instead
of being garnished with cans of
soup and meat, as I suspect them to be.”
And I started forth to rescue the capsized
boat, but the tide had carried it on
the reef, the mast caught between two
rocks, and, already strained as it was, it
cracked and broke.</p>

<p>And I was due to meet my wife and
some other friends off Rye in a couple
of hours. That’s what comes of going
off on a lady’s sailing party, each man
to be sailed down by a girl. A foolish
idea, and hatched out, you may be sure,
in the crazy pates of Felicia and her
friend, Lydia Massingbyrd.</p>

<p>I did what I could for the poor boat.
It’s a light little thing, an eighteen-foot
cat, and, as I’ve often told Mason,
heavily oversparred. I got her on the
beach without much trouble, while my
companion inquired anxiously, from
time to time, as to the state of the
larder.</p>

<p>I found I was right. There was
soup, and shortly I was warming it by
means of a wire cleverly slung around
it and a wooden handle. For, luckily,
my match case was watertight.</p>

<p>“Necessity is the mother of invention,”
said I, taking my companion into
favor again.</p>

<p>“Necessity is the mother of indigestion!”
she retorted, and I saw her mind
was back with our shipwrecked flesh-pots.
“I can’t bear canned things!”</p>

<p>She spread her long, wet hair around
her like a mantle; the corners of her
mouth drooped with a pathetic quiver,
changed their mind and flickered out
into a radiant little smile, which in its
turn gave way to a long chuckle.</p>

<p>“I never quite understood about jibing,”
she remarked. “But now I understand
perfectly. It’s about the
suddenest thing I know. I’ve a very
objective mind. A thing has to be put
before me actually, in the flesh, for me
to comprehend it. That’s what I shall
tell the reporters.”</p>

<p>“Reporters?” I wondered.</p>

<p>“Reporters, of course,” she repeated.
“And the longer we’re out here, the
more there’ll be! They won’t begin to
hunt for us until to-night. It’s a good
thing Felicia is my lifelong friend;” and
Mrs. Massingbyrd laughed again. The
situation had none of the serious aspects
to her that it had to me. Of course
Felicia was Lydia Massingbyrd’s friend,
but no woman cares to have her husband
absent and missing with another
woman, and what with the anxiety and
reporters and all&mdash;no, I didn’t look forward
to the next two or three days.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd’s spirits rose during
lunch.</p>

<p>“After a swim canned things aren’t
really so awful,” she conceded. “I suppose
they’ll tell the police and get out
searchlights. I’ve had most things
happen to me, but this is quite brand
new.”</p>

<p>“One would think you were a popular
actress,” I complained.</p>

<p>“Well, so, in a way, I am,” she philosophized.</p>

<p>Her hair was drying fast, and hung
about her a dress of living gold. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
black silk bathing suit fitted her closely
in all the places it ought not to. I
marveled that so slender a little creature
could be at the same time so deliciously
rounded. Her face, ever so
slightly tanned, had all sorts of delicious
golden tones, her eyes were surprisingly
blue and as candidly innocent as those
of a delightful child. In her short skirt
and her golden hair, so meek in its
color, so wayward in its curls, she
looked like a little girl.</p>

<p>“Lydia Massingbyrd,” I found myself
saying spontaneously, “I forgive you
everything! And it’s a lucky thing for
me I’m deeply in love with Felicia.”</p>

<p>“I told you you’d be glad you came,”
she said, joyously.</p>

<p>“It was worth the price,” I generously
conceded. “Your lovely mane is all
you have pretended it was. ‘It’s all
wool’!”</p>

<p>“A sail!” cried Mrs. Massingbyrd,
pointing to a yawl that even as she
spoke had rounded the island.</p>

<p>“It’s the Phillips’ yawl,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“Conscientiously, I don’t suppose we
can stay shipwrecked any longer than
we can help. We’ll have to give up the
reporters!” There was a note of disappointment
in her voice. “Shout, Bobby!”</p>

<p>I shouted.</p>

<p>“They don’t hear us. What we need
is a flag of distress. Wave, wave your
coat!” Then catching her long hair in
both her hands, she held it far above
her head and waved it like a golden
banner. The wind caught it and played
with it; in her eager abandon she
looked like some Mænad, some fire
spirit&mdash;choose your own simile for her,
but in that moment out there in the full
sunlight she had I know not what touch
of the superterrestrial.</p>

<p>I believe at that moment it was given
to me to see her at the highest point of
her somewhat amazing beauty. As she
stood there her hand was holding her
wonderful hair above her head; she was
for a moment outside the pale of
everyday womanhood. She was, I tell
you, something to commit follies for.</p>

<p>They saw us. The boat put about.
Mrs. Massingbyrd let fall the most original
and the most beautiful flag that
ever waved distress.</p>

<p>“They’ve recognized me,” she remarked
with satisfaction. She held a
strand of hair high above her head and
let it fall. “There isn’t anyone who
could have done that.”</p>

<p>“Or who would have done it if they
could,” I added, severely.</p>

<p>“Or who would have done it if they
could,” she agreed. “Not all women
are so conscientious as to what they owe
mankind.”</p>

<p>“Indeed they are not,” I put in, sarcastically.</p>

<p>She was on her knees, gathering her
hairpins and combs.</p>

<p>“Let your light so shine before men,”
said she, cheerfully. “A city that’s
built on a hill cannot be hid. Don’t put
your candle under a bushel.”</p>

<p>I was putting on my shoes&mdash;now
fairly well dried&mdash;and my ruined collar,
just to show I had one.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re the vainest woman
on the seacoast,” I scolded. I am the
only man in all Lydia Massingbyrd’s
acquaintance who never flatters her, and
who from time to time gives her the
great benefit of hearing the whole
truth about herself.</p>

<p>“I suppose I am, and good reason,
too;” and there was some heat in her
voice. Her back was toward me; all I
could see of her was a mass of silvery
gold.</p>

<p>“Now, what shall I do?” she asked.
“There’s plenty of time to put up my
hair any which way&mdash;it would look
horrid&mdash;I look so nice like this&mdash;now,
what would you do?”</p>

<p>“You ought to put it up,” I conclusively
told her. “It’s an indecent exposure.
One would think, to look at
you, that you were playing tableaux of
Lady Godiva.”</p>

<p>“I shall never get such another
chance,” she implored.</p>

<p>“Put up your hair, Lydia Massingbyrd,”
I commanded.</p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to do this,” she
moaned. “And now just as there’s going
to be any good in it you bully me.”
Her mouth dropped again, she looked
at me with appealingly candid eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, have it your way,” I growled.
“Show off before Phillips, and Almington,
and little Cecilia Bennett, and Mrs.
Day, and the Drake boys!”</p>

<p>“Almington!” exclaimed Mrs. Massingbyrd.
“That settles it!” and she
resolutely shook out her hair again.</p>

<p>“Almington!” I exclaimed, in amazement.
“Why does Almington settle
it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t bear the man!” cried she,
stamping her foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if this is by way of punishment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cecilia Bennett’s sister is one of my
dearest friends.” Apparently she
thought this was an explanation.</p>

<p>“And so you want Cecilia to see you
with your hair down,” I sneered.</p>

<p>“Men are <i>too</i> dense!” was all she
vouchsafed me. “He’s a popinjay of a
professional heart-breaker.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll know what they’ll
say about you?” I tried another tack.</p>

<p>“I know what they’ll think,” she told
me, with her inimitable calm.</p>

<p>“If you have the nerve, it’s no business
of mine,” I conceded.</p>

<p>“Felicia’ll be so busy scolding me
that she’ll forget all about you,” she
suggested, naïvely.</p>

<p>“There’s something in that,” I was
manly enough to confess.</p>

<p>The boat now lay-to in the shallow
water. Phillips hailed us.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to put your hair up,” I
told her. “They’ve got no dinghy.
We’ll have to swim for it.”</p>

<p>“And wet myself all over again? No,
indeed; you’ll have to carry me,” she
calmly announced. “They can come
inshore as far as that.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to square me with Felicia,”
I muttered.</p>

<p>Laughingly Lydia Massingbyrd made
a rope of her hair, to keep it safe from
the water, that she might the better
blind the poor wretches in the boat with
its radiance. So carry her I did. As
we were well out in the water I heard
the snap of Almington’s camera.</p>

<p>“Won’t Felicia be in a wax?” the
incorrigible woman giggled in my ear.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for you it’s me,” I said
to her, critically. “Even as it is, it’s
most imprudent!”</p>

<p>She looked at me, an impudent gleam
in her eye.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty careful in choosing my
company when I’m cast away on a
desert island,” said she.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>“I don’t understand women at all,”
I rather rashly confessed to Felicia.</p>

<p>“That’s all the better for us&mdash;I mean
for me,” she threw back at me.</p>

<p>“But I do understand you’re all a
matchmaking lot,” I continued, severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re a matchmaking lot, are
we?” Felicia’s tone was one of flattering
interest. She was arranging a bit
of vine that had somehow gotten torn
down. She now turned toward me, the
picture of innocent surprise.</p>

<p>“You like matchmaking for the fun
of the thing&mdash;just as a man likes shooting,”
I went on. “You’d marry any
person to any other person, regardless
of age, position or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sex?” suggested Felicia, politely.</p>

<p>“Suitability,” I amended; “just for
the sake of having a wedding.”</p>

<p>“You’re talking now in the manner
and tone of a husband,” Felicia accusingly
told me. “Anyone who heard
your voice afar off would know you
were one.” I paid no attention to Felicia’s
interruption.</p>

<p>“If I’m not right, kindly tell me if
Lydia Massingbyrd wasn’t matchmaking
when she got you to ask Almington
and little Cecilia Bennett down here;
and if you weren’t matchmaking when
you consented to ask them.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it’s because Lydia is
anxious to arrange a marriage between
them she wanted them here.” Felicia’s
tone was so guilelessly axiomatic that it
made me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Has she told you?”</p>

<p>“She’s told me nothing,” Felicia assured
me. “If she’d told me her reasons
I couldn’t, as she very well knows,
have asked them.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why I say,” I concluded,
“that I don’t understand women. First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Lydia Massingbyrd told me she couldn’t
bear Almington. Then she did her little
Venus-rising-from-the-sea act for his
benefit. And then, I tell you, Felicia, if
ever a mortal woman flirted, it was your
little golden-locked friend. And, Jove,
she was pretty!”</p>

<p>“What Lydia Massingbyrd needs is a
husband,” Felicia declared, “who would
keep her from tampering with other
people’s! You’ve been utterly ruined
ever since you went around that day
carrying Lydia all over the place. You
talk about her hair in your sleep.”</p>

<p>Again I ignored Felicia and her unjust
accusations. “Poor little Cecilia
Bennett! Between admiration and fear
she was almost frightened to death.”</p>

<p>“Cecilia is a nice, upstanding, decent
little girl,” Felicia asserted, aggressively.</p>

<p>“So she is, so she is,” I hastened to
agree. “And that is why&mdash;she being
only two months out of Farmington&mdash;you
want to marry her to a man like
Almington!”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with Almington?”
asked Felicia, still in her most guileless
manner, which I have learned to know
is the most finished form of impertinence.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Almington?”
I exclaimed. “Oh, nothing at all! He’s
the stuff perfect husbands are made of.
He’s ripe, is Almington, for a little, innocent
flower of a girl like Cecilia.”</p>

<p>“Almington’s lots of money,” said
Felicia, reflectively; “and Cecilia’s
mother’s keen for it. You know there’s
no end to the Bennett girls, and they’re
poor as anything.”</p>

<p>I maintained a disgusted silence, for
I had an inkling that Felicia would have
been charmed with an outbreak from
me about the iniquity of sacrificing
young girls on the altar of Mammon.
I therefore resolved to commit myself
no further.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Mrs. Massingbyrd
arrived.</p>

<p>The two ladies embraced. Then Felicia
held her friend at arms’ length.</p>

<p>“Remember,” she warned, “no Croquemitaine!
I’ve done two things for
you&mdash;what you wanted me to&mdash;and
I’ve asked no questions. So go ahead,
but no Lady Godiva here under my roof-tree.
No, nor any coming out shrieking
burglars at two with your hair down,
Lydia Massingbyrd!” And Felicia
gave her friend an affectionate shake.</p>

<p>I had the sense that there had passed
between the two women intelligences far
beyond what appeared on the surface;
a feeling that there were in the air all
kinds of things&mdash;and that these things
had passed over my head. In fact, I
felt hopelessly at a disadvantage, as a
man so often does in the presence of
his wife and his wife’s intimate friend;
in a word, I suppose I felt like a husband,
and I was glad enough to join
young Drake, who had come up in the
same train with little Cecilia Bennett.</p>

<p>As we strolled off <span class="locked">together&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There’s something awfully nice
about a really fresh young girl, when
one’s been knocking around with older
women a bit,” he confided to me.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing as charming as an
unspoiled girl,” I agreed. “And Cecilia
is that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but the French way is
the best. I hate a young girl who’s
too darned knowing.”</p>

<p>Now, I knew that Ellery Drake had
made calf love to Felicia when Felicia
herself had been a young girl of the
kind he so eloquently described as “too
darned knowing”; and that he had in
vain followed the fascinating wake of
Mrs. Massingbyrd. So it was not
without malice I replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, the less a little, young girl
knows the better; give me a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tabula rara</i>
any time.”</p>

<p>Ellery Drake looked at me sharply.
“I shouldn’t go as far as that,” he said.
“But I like them like Cecilia&mdash;so awfully
interested in things you know, and a
little bit shy, and all that. Gee! Did
you see her stare when you toted Mrs.
Massingbyrd into the boat the other
day?”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” I said. “You don’t see
things like that every day.”</p>

<p>“She’s a wonder, Mrs. Massingbyrd”&mdash;Drake
was full of enthusiasm&mdash;“but
almost <i>too</i> spectacular for a quiet man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I think Cecilia was really a little
shocked.”</p>

<p>I had noted poor little Cecilia’s what-have-we-here-and-whatever-is-the-world-coming-to
expression.</p>

<p>There’s nothing quite as conventional
as your properly-brought-up young person;
and Cecilia was as perfectly turned
out a specimen as a wise mother and a
good school could accomplish. She
was, in fact, the beau ideal of the young
person for whom we keep our magazines
spotlessly pure, and in whose behalf
we cry aloud when a play is not
better than it should be.</p>

<p>“She said afterward,” Drake told me,
“that she felt as if she’d been reading
one of those society papers that haven’t
the best reputation in the world.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she was up to that,” I
remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know Cecilia. She’s
really very funny when you get her
alone,” Drake protested. “I’ve known
her ever since I was knee-high, so, you
see, she’s not a bit shy with me. When
she was a little kid, I’d no idea she’d
turn out so pretty. The trouble is, they
get spoiled so soon,” Drake gloomily
went on&mdash;“spoiled and knowing and
worldly.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect a flower to keep
in bud forever.”</p>

<p>“But you can train it to be a nice,
sweet, modest, homekeeping plant, or
an exotic thing trained for the flower
show.”</p>

<p>He puffed at his cigarette. I saw he
thought he’d gotten off a good thing.
When I’m with Drake I understand
only too well the kind of amusement I
so frequently afford Felicia. He enhanced
the resemblance by now saying:</p>

<p>“I don’t understand women at all!”</p>

<p>“No?” I encouraged him.</p>

<p>“What the devil is a sweet little thing
like Cecilia Bennett doing messing
around with a fellow like Almington?”</p>

<p>“He’ll soon take off the bloom,” I
said.</p>

<p>If the women were going to match-make,
it occurred to me I could do a
little work of the kind off my own bat,
and I was pleased with my dexterity
when Drake enthusiastically snatched
at the bait.</p>

<p>“You bet he will,” he said. “He’s
not the man for a young girl like Cecilia;
nothing more than a baby, you
know, who doesn’t know how to take
care of herself. Though I’ve nothing
against Almington. He’s all right for
married women.”</p>

<p>“A perfect companion for Felicia and
Mrs. Massingbyrd,” I sarcastically
threw in, but my sarcasm didn’t touch
Ellery Drake, for he said, simply:</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right for <i>them</i>!”</p>

<p>“So,” I said, magnanimously, “let
them take care of him. He’s coming
down to-night, and you keep Cecilia out
of his clutches.”</p>

<p>Roars of mirth, in which I distinguished
the voices of my wife, Mrs.
Massingbyrd and Cecilia, now interrupted
us, and they all came running
across the lawn like a troop of charming,
grown-up children.</p>

<p>Indeed, Felicia and Mrs. Massingbyrd
seemed younger than their little
companion. I’ve told you that Lydia
Massingbyrd has the youngest, most
candid eyes I’ve ever seen; and she and
Felicia ran down the lawn with the
abandon of those who know their
world.</p>

<p>Spontaneity is one of civilization’s
most perfect flowers, and Cecilia wasn’t
as yet civilized enough to have acquired
it. She followed the others with a certain
dry rigidity that I found perfectly
charming for her age and the time she
had been in the world.</p>

<p>“No, no; you can’t come,” said Mrs.
Massingbyrd, waving us back. “You’ll
know soon enough. Don’t tell, Cecilia;”
and she caught the child by the arm and
carried her along, as they made for the
stable.</p>

<p>There was something preposterous in
the air. I have known Felicia long
enough to recognize a certain irresponsible
little laugh as a danger signal.
Presently the children came back, Mrs.
Massingbyrd with Cecilia still tucked
under her wing.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the strangest thing,” she
was chattering, “the impression I produce
on strangers! First they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
call me <i>Miss</i> Massingbyrd, then, later,
they always ask where Massingbyrd is!
Not one person in a thousand will believe
I’m a real, bona-fide, dyed-in-the-wool
widow!”</p>

<p>Cecilia’s eyes were open wide. I
could see in her attitude that she didn’t
think it good taste to joke about being
taken for a divorcée. Nor did I, and
I wondered what my friend was up to,
for generally Mrs. Massingbyrd adapts
herself to her company with all the flexibility
in the world.</p>

<p>I followed them into the house, and I
was in time to see as pretty a little tableau
as ever was presented on the stage.</p>

<p>Discovered on the piazza was Almington,
and at sight of him my little
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ingénue</i>, Cecilia, hesitated, and was lost
in a sea of blushes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd ran forward and
greeted him gayly and gladly. Mamma’s
training came to Cecilia’s aid; she
gathered herself together and, in spite
of burning cheeks and very bright eyes,
advanced to meet Almington in good
order.</p>

<p>He greeted her pleasantly but indifferently,
and turned eagerly to Mrs.
Massingbyrd.</p>

<p>“You’re none the worse for your shipwreck,
I hope,” he asked.</p>

<p>“I never had a pleasanter day,” Mrs.
Massingbyrd assured him. “It’s not
often I get a chance to display my only
beauty free and unrebuked.”</p>

<p>“Your pictures came out well,” said
Almington. “I couldn’t wait for the
film to be through. I had it developed
at once;” and he felt in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd held out her rosy
palm, then drew it back.</p>

<p>“No, not here,” she decided. “Come
down to the rose garden and show them
to me there. After all, they’re just for
you and me.” And it was with a self-satisfied
air, the air of a conqueror, that
Almington unfolded his long legs and
followed Mrs. Massingbyrd.</p>

<p>I looked at my companions. Cecilia’s
cheeks were still hot. I saw she was a
little bewildered, but she acted like a
little thoroughbred, and made pretty,
perfunctory, young-girl talk with Felicia,
whose face told me nothing; and
with Drake, who looked profoundly
pleased.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd and her cavalier
were strolling up and down in the rose
garden at the foot of the terrace. Coquetry
was in every movement of her
little blond head. Conquest was written
large on Almington.</p>

<p>In pursuance of my own little policy,
“There goes a lost man,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“He’s been lost so often and won so
often that it doesn’t matter much, does
it?” said Felicia, lightly. “So if it’s only
he that’s lost, we won’t have far to look
for him.”</p>

<p>“I thought Mrs. Mass. had turned
him down,” remarked Ellery Drake.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t apparently prevented his
turning up again,” Felicia replied, pertly.</p>

<p>I looked at Cecilia. Mamma’s training
held good; there was a visible strain
about her attitude, but she did her best
to seem natural. It was Cecilia’s first
time under fire, and she did her superior
officers credit. But there was that about
the still babyish lines of her mouth
which showed me that she longed to be
away by herself and have a good cry.
Drake couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>

<p>“Come on, Cecilia, let us go for a
walk, too,” he suggested. And while
I blessed him for his kindness I thought
the “too” unfortunate.</p>

<p>When they were out of earshot I
turned severely to Felicia.</p>

<p>“I don’t consider the Torture of the
Innocents a pretty game,” I told her.</p>

<p>“Tell that to Lydia,” was all I got
out of my wife.</p>

<p>“I thought Cecilia’s sister was a
great friend of Lydia’s,” I asked.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Felicia assented, dryly.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>“For a spotless child of heaven, Cecilia’s
playing the game pretty well,” I
mused, as I watched her at dinner.
During the hour of dressing she had
pulled herself wonderfully together.
She held her little round chin high in
the air and devoted herself to Drake
with all the aplomb of a Felicia.</p>

<p>The cup of bitterness held its touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of sweet to her. Even if one must suffer,
one was out in the world, one was
living, was what I read in her attitude.
But as I have said, I don’t pretend to
understand women; still, I’m much
mistaken if, during dinner, at least, she
didn’t have a good time.</p>

<p>She ignored Almington as much as
she could in a general conversation.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Massingbyrd can have you,”
her attitude seemed to say. “I fight for
no man.”</p>

<p>I looked at Drake. If he wanted to
keep his rose in the bud, he had better
carry her away quickly to a fresher atmosphere.</p>

<p>At the end of dinner the ladies exchanged
nods and smiles. I saw that
an explanation was forthcoming for the
mysterious visit to the stable.</p>

<p>They had been preparing what to me
seemed not unlike a little amateur Walpurgisnacht.</p>

<p>It was, of course, Lydia Massingbyrd’s
idea. Nobody else, not even Felicia,
could have been wrong-minded
enough to want to slide downhill in
summer. My coachman’s children
have a species of roller sled on which
they daily endanger their lives by coasting
down the steep macadamized road
which leads from my house.</p>

<p>“I saw them on my way from the
station,” proclaimed Mrs. Massingbyrd,
triumphantly; “and saw at once their
possibilities.”</p>

<p>“Will you steer me, Mr. Curtis?”
asked Cecilia, turning her back on Almington,
and giving poor Drake a killing
glance; and I thought I surprised a
glance of malicious intelligence pass between
Mrs. Massingbyrd and my wife.</p>

<p>Now, I know that, told in plain
words the morning after, most of our
maddest fun seems flat and puerile
enough. I know that a decent married
man of my age and a lady killer of
Almington’s ought to have poohpoohed
this childish sport, and sat with our
cigars and our whiskies and sodas on
the piazza.</p>

<p>I suppose you think that’s what you
would have done. But I can tell you, if
you had dined with Felicia and Mrs.
Massingbyrd, you’d have been caught
up in the fire of their folly. It’s contagious,
more than anything I know.
In the glamour of their lovely nonsense
sliding downhill on the coachman’s
children’s roller sled would have seemed
an appropriate and delightful thing&mdash;or
sliding down the banister or the cellar
door, if it had been their mad whim to
do that.</p>

<p>Haven’t you ever been a kid since
you were grown up? Did all your fooling
stop before you were out of college?
I’m sorry for you if it’s so. I
hope, for my part, that Felicia and Mrs.
Massingbyrd and their like will make
me forget my years for a long time to
come. And I hope often to wake up in
the sober light of the next day wondering
just what magic it was that had
turned back the hand of time for me,
that I could find merriment in sliding
down a macadamized hill on a roller
sled.</p>

<p>The night was cold, with a bit of a
breeze; there was a moon, and the glow
from Felicia’s gayety and Lydia Massingbyrd
lasted my little companion on
our first swift, delirious slides.</p>

<p>It wasn’t coasting, but it was exciting
enough, as one went very fast. And
coming up we piled into a cart to be
drawn up the hill. But after a few
slides the flame of my little friend’s gayety
flickered out, and as the others were
piling into the cart, “Let’s walk,” Cecilia
suggested. Youth is ever selfish
in its distress, and what did Cecilia care
whether my legs were tired or not
climbing that hill? Her little flock of
conventions had come fluttering back
to her. Her doll was sawdust, and there
was a bad taste in her mouth.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you know that
there’s nothing more revolting than the
folly of others when you yourself are
serious. Haven’t you been annoyed
time and again by the senseless and
meaningless good spirits of the people
next door? I’m sure you have. And
just as often you’ve felt a certain compassion
for the people who give you
sour looks and grim glances when
you’re having the time of your life.</p>

<p>So it was with ever-increasing disapproval
of my wife’s merriment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Mrs. Massingbyrd’s abandon that Cecilia
walked up the hill with me.</p>

<p>“I think,” she confided to me, sadly,
“I was born old!”</p>

<p>“There are some people who stay
babies forever,” I encouraged her.</p>

<p>“They are the fortunate ones,” Cecilia
said, gloomily. “I never have been
able to enjoy things long at a time.
Even our good times at school used to
seem childish to me. And I thought
when I came out and was among grown
people&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That things would be different,” I
supplemented. “And you find it’s just
the same.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” she agreed, in a
gratified tone. “I feel as old as I did
at school!”</p>

<p>“Some people are born with a realization
of the futility of pleasure,” I went
on, trying to voice Cecilia’s mood.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s that,” she sighed.
“When I was at school I thought of the
world as a playground where I could
amuse myself with the others.”</p>

<p>“And instead, you find that you’re
only learning a different kind of lesson,
and play is as uninteresting as ever?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s just like another kind of
school, and the lessons harder to learn&mdash;and
of less use when you’ve learned
them!” There was a pathetic note in
her voice.</p>

<p>“You’re very different from other
girls, Miss Bennett,” I felt was an appropriate
and comforting thing to say.</p>

<p>“I know I am, and it’s a great misfortune
to be so,” she acknowledged,
with becoming modesty.</p>

<p>“But it has its compensations.”</p>

<p>“It’s very lonely,” she said. “No one
has ever understood all I think and feel.
Mamma never has, nor the girls.”</p>

<p>“And since you’ve been out?”</p>

<p>“Since I’ve been out I met some one&mdash;once”&mdash;the
once threw the time of
meeting in the remote past&mdash;“some one
I thought understood me&mdash;but I was
disappointed.”</p>

<p>I murmured something sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Because I’m young in years people
think I can’t see things,” she cried, with
a little rising temper.</p>

<p>“You have the best possible vantage,
then, to observe the world as it really
is.”</p>

<p>“And I do see things as they really
are, and many things!” and she clinched
her little fists under cover of the darkness.
Things were getting somewhat
strenuous for me, so I brought our conversational
boat to smoother waters.</p>

<p>“You make me think a little of Ellery
Drake,” I said. (Machiavelli to
the front!) “Because he seems so simple
and direct; shallow people don’t
take the trouble to understand him. But
you’ve seen, of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented; and I saw she
was interested.</p>

<p>“What a lonely time he has of it,
and under his apparent simplicity how
much depth there is.”</p>

<p>“I’ve known him all my life&mdash;but I’ve
never really known him&mdash;that is, what
<i>I</i> call knowing a person.” There was
a great deal of intensity in Cecilia’s
voice. “Ah, how hard it is to really
know any&mdash;and so few realize it.” The
atmosphere was getting a little rarefied,
so I was glad of the diversion caused
by the two roller sleds whiffling by us.</p>

<p>“We’re racing,” called Mrs. Massingbyrd.
“If we win, I’m to grant a boon
to Jack Almington.”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably ask her to take down
her hair,” said Machiavelli. “Men always
do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if that sort of thing amuses
him”&mdash;contempt spoke in Cecilia’s tone&mdash;“let
him have&mdash;his hank of hair!”</p>

<p>“There’s a remarkably happy man,” I
said. “No still waters in his; a perfectly
delightful fellow, only spoiled by
women!”</p>

<p>“Is he?” asked Cecilia, indifferently.</p>

<p>“He’s been so immensely liked, you
know, that what he really needs is a
snub. He thinks he’s only to look at a
woman for him to like her.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t one call that just a trifle
conceited?” Cecilia’s voice dripped
sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Not in his case,” I returned, cruelly.
“For, you see, it’s generally so.
I’ve never known a more fatal man than
Almington.”</p>

<p>“He’s not <i>always</i> fatal,” Cecilia gave
out, dryly; and she shut her little mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
with a firmness that even in the dim
moonlight made itself visible.</p>

<p>We stood at the top of the hill in silence
for a moment, waiting for the
cart with the others in it. They came
up laughing. How vain and empty
their laughter was, I was sure Cecilia
was thinking. Her deep knowledge of
the world and its iniquity were fairly
bowing down her young shoulders.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The laughter and nonsense grew
louder, and I descried, standing upright
in the cart, a vision, spirit or woman I
couldn’t tell.</p>

<p>My companion stared a moment and
then remarked:</p>

<p>“<i>Mrs. Massingbyrd’s hair has come
down!</i>” Into these simple words was
packed all the quintessence of disapproval
that Cecilia had learned from her
various advisers. There were echoes of
her mother’s shocked tones, haunting
accents of her offended teacher, all
welded together by the cool disapproval
that was Cecilia’s own.</p>

<p>I am sure that if my delightful little
guest could have heard the awful, the
chilling, contempt of “Mrs. Massingbyrd’s
hair has come down,” she would
have veiled her face with it in abject
shame.</p>

<p>I gathered by her attitude and that
of Felicia and Almington that these silly
creatures were playing at tableaux, the
cart serving as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mi-carême char</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Massingbyrd’s hair, more miraculous
than ever in the moonlight, fell
down to her knees. Her eyes looked seraphically
heavenward. Almington held
her hand, kneeling before her, while
Felicia, a little shawl disposed as drapery
about her, was pointing dramatically
out into the night, giving an admirable
impersonation of those statuesque young
ladies who, in tableaux, have no <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison
d’être</i> save to round out the composition
and look pretty.</p>

<p>Later I learned that the name of this
impressive tableau was: “The Triumph
of Virtue.”</p>

<p>At that moment I was too occupied
with the attitude of my little companion
to pay attention to Mrs. Massingbyrd’s
foolery.</p>

<p>Cecilia had just caught sight of Almington
as he knelt, holding the hand
of Virtue, his lean legs bent like the
blade of a knife. Almington generally
cuts a fine figure, through a certain
sense of the fitness of things. His air
of secret melancholy wins half his battles
for him, and he is one of those men
who must at any cost hang on to the last
shred of dignity, as they are nothing
without it. In his present situation I
have no hesitation in saying he looked
fatuous and grotesque.</p>

<p>How he came to lend himself to the
crazy whim of the two girls I can’t tell.
I suppose he was carried away by the
flood of their high spirits, as many a
wiser man has been before him and will
be after him.</p>

<p>But if I had excuses for him, Cecilia
had none.</p>

<p>It may be heartbreaking to have your
first “serious young man” leave you at
the smiles of a pretty widow with blond
hair; but, after all, by showing how
truly noble you are, you may some day
crush your rival and bring your suitor
to your knees, crying, “Peccavi!” It’s
bad to learn he’s a heartbreaker, but,
after all, then there’s all the more incentive
to break his heart. You can, whatever
happens, bear your suffering nobly,
and at the worst you have lots of
things, heaps simply, to tell the girls.</p>

<p>But to have your first hero of romance
make himself ridiculous&mdash;that is
the end of all things. Sorrow has then
no dignity. A broken heart for a man
like that is out of the question. Oh, it’s
a bitter thing to think the drama of
one’s life a tragedy and have it turn out
a low comedy!</p>

<p>Cecilia saw her hero exactly as he
was, at that moment, stripped of all
adornment.</p>

<p>Glamour died, romance withered
away; in the clear fire of her uncompromising
young scorn.</p>

<p>She was proving again that man’s
only unpardonable crime toward the
woman who loves him is to make himself
ridiculous.</p>

<p>It was really quite a dramatic little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
moment. The late hero, now turned
mountebank, descended and helped out
Felicia and Lydia, radiant in her white
and gold attire&mdash;and it was only then I
saw Drake, who had been sitting stiffly
in the back of the cart.</p>

<p><i>He</i> had taken no part in the pageant.
If his temper was impaired, his dignity
wasn’t. Sliding downhill was all right,
his rigidity seemed to say, but no play
acting in his. His mood and Cecilia’s
jumped together. Her eyes met his. “I
know you now,” her grateful glance
seemed to say.</p>

<p>Meantime Mrs. Massingbyrd, lovely
as an angel, drifted along the white
road.</p>

<p>“It’s breaking the rules of the
game,” Felicia said to her, “for you to
have taken down your hair.”</p>

<p>“It fell down itself,” answered Lydia
the unashamed.</p>

<p>“But you looked so entirely lovely,”
my wife went on, “that I forgive you.
It’s worth the price.”</p>

<p>And I guiltily hoped that Mrs. Massingbyrd
would refrain from saying,
“That’s exactly what Bobby said.”</p>

<p>She stood pensive a moment in the
moonlight. Drake and Cecilia, drawn
together by the feeling of superiority
they shared in common&mdash;and which I
had helped to point out&mdash;wandered off
together. Almington was absorbed in
an open and impertinent admiration
of Mrs. Massingbyrd’s beauty, and Felicia
and I gazed at her, and again Felicia
said, approvingly: “It’s an unfair
advantage to take&mdash;but it’s really worth
it!”</p>

<p>Then the dreamy look in lovely Mrs.
Massingbyrd’s eyes deepened, and she
opened her lovely lips and said:</p>

<p>“Felicia, I’m so desperately hungry
that I wouldn’t coast down that hill
again&mdash;not for anything! Did you say
you had something good for supper?”</p>

<p>“And at supper I shall ask my boon,”
Almington answered.</p>

<p>“Boon?” said Mrs. Massingbyrd, as
she watched Cecilia and Drake vanish
together in the moonlight among the
flowers. “Boon? You greedy person!
Isn’t it boon enough to have seen me
with my hair down by moonlight! I
wonder at your graspingness, Jack
Almington!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>After we had said good-night to our
guests, after Cecilia and Drake had at
last come in from an interminable talk
on the piazza, after Mrs. Massingbyrd
had stuffed herself&mdash;in the face of her
ethereal loveliness I hate to use such a
word, but I know no other; indeed, she
applied herself to supper with such a
fair, frank and honest appetite that she
had neither eyes nor ears for Almington’s
compliments&mdash;after all this was
over, Felicia turned to me with a look
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You played up nobly that time, Robert,”
she said. “I’ve never known you
to catch on so quickly and without a
word from anyone.”</p>

<p>I gained time with remarking, pathetically,
“You’ve always underrated
my intelligence.”</p>

<p>“I call it a thoroughly artistic performance,”
my wife said; “and the
beauty of it is that there was no talk,
no nothing, but each one doing his
work.”</p>

<p>I looked at Felicia, to see if by any
chance she was making a pitfall for me,
but there was no danger signal. I
thought it safe to give out, “I’m glad
you liked my little share in it.”</p>

<p>“You were splendid,” she cried, cordially.
“And if Miss Bennett only
knew it, we deserve a vote of thanks
from her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t we?” I took care not
to commit myself.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as if we hadn’t provided Cecilia
with another suitor, and I’m sure
Ellery Drake, from any point of view,
is far more desirable than Almington.”</p>

<p>“I should say he was,” I cordially
assented.</p>

<p>“And then, who can tell if Almington
was really serious? And for a
young girl to be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affichée</i> with Almington
her first season is nothing short
of tarnishing,” Felicia went on, virtuously.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve said from the beginning,”
I put in.</p>

<p>“And you certainly played up nobly.
We couldn’t have put it through so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
quickly without you,” my wife was generous
enough to confess. “But did you
ever see anything as splendid and self-sacrificing
as Lydia?”</p>

<p>“Self-sacrificing?” I wondered, feeling
my way.</p>

<p>“Why, she made herself odious&mdash;simply
odious&mdash;in Cecilia’s eyes, so Cecilia
would feel furious at having Almington
like her.” Sometimes Felicia
is anything but lucid.</p>

<p>“Like whom?” I naturally wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Like Lydia,” replied my wife, impatiently.
“A girl can stand anything but
having a man she likes fall in love with
a woman she doesn’t. It’s queer,” she
said, suspiciously, “clever as you are
sometimes, how dense you are others.
<i>Did</i> you understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But at this late date I wasn’t going
to have my laurels snatched from me.
So I hastened to assure her. “Of
course,” I said, loftily, “I understood
Mrs. Massingbyrd intended to interfere!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/ig.png" width="124" height="123" alt="G" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">GERTRUDE Warrener
was twenty-five
years old on
the day she went into
the back library and,
seated in a rocking
chair, a newspaper and a box of candy-kitchen
chocolates in her lap&mdash;began to
live.</p>

<p>Hitherto the boundaries of her lifeline
had been limited by a wooden fence
circling a few feet of coarse grass and
two frame houses like her own. To the
rear, in the yard, four poles formed a
square with peculiar precision, and on
washdays the level lines of a cord,
stretching cat’s-cradle-wise, supported
the household laundry.</p>

<p>She had taken for eight years the
front rooms of the house for her point
of vantage, and when she had mentally
stated “Mrs. Felter’s just gone into the
Perches’,” or “Pearl Exeter does her
marketing in the afternoons instead of
the mornings,” she had nothing further
to say. One day she caught herself in
the middle of some such banal reflection,
and, going to the back of the
house, took her place in the window of
a microscopic library.</p>

<p>Gertrude Warrener did not remotely
dream that she on this day passed the
Rubicon lying between existence and
life.</p>

<p>When the mind is sensible of inertia&mdash;the
eyes catch sight of living forms,
and the soul yearns toward something
which it has not&mdash;it may be taken for
granted that a life-breath has blown
over the valley of dead bones.</p>

<p>In the case of Gertrude Warrener,
it was indeed a tomb in which she
awakened, and she did not know that
she had been immured.</p>

<p>In her seventeenth year, George Warrener,
just received into a
subordinate position in a
New York banking and
broking firm, began to pay
her his bashful attentions.
With no spoken words on
his part that she could remember&mdash;nor
could he for the life of him have
recalled the formula&mdash;there was an engagement.
She married him before her
eighteenth birthday.</p>

<p>As she sat in the library, all image
of the youthful lover was completely effaced
from her mind. He was now like
hundreds and dozens of other middle-rank
business men. Of medium height,
stocky, his hair and short, stubby mustache
nondescript, his eyes blue, wide
apart and rather small, he was a successful
type and entirely sacrificed as
an individual. He often said:</p>

<p>“I look like a prosperous Wall Street
man, and that is as near as I shall ever
come to it&mdash;to look like it.”</p>

<p>But in spite of his dapper appearance,
Warrener was an overworked drudge.
He worked so hard and so long, his
daily trips on unhealthy ferries and hot
cars sapped his vitality to such an extent,
that all his life had been spent and
lived by the time he crossed at night the
threshold of his home.</p>

<p>Gertrude in the little library opened
the pages of the <i>Slocum Daily</i> slowly.
She read the town gossip, a local
weather prediction, an account of the
hospital fair; and as she rocked and ate
one after the other the chocolate marshmallows
she had a feeling of freedom,
whose cause was due simply to the fact
that she had changed her point of view&mdash;due
to the humble novelty of her
transposition.</p>

<p>George’s library smelled of stale tobacco.
She had sensitive nostrils, and
was beginning to find the dead odor
unpleasant, when at this point she fell
upon an item in the <i>Slocum Daily</i> which
held her attention:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are glad to learn that the McAllister
homestead has been opened. After the long
absence in Europe of the family, Mr. and
Mrs. Bellamy have returned, and Slocum
welcomes them back with much pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Slocum!” She spoke aloud, and
there was scorn in her tone. “Well, I
guess they’ll laugh at that. I don’t believe
<i>they</i> care for the <i>Daily</i>!”</p>

<p>Old Mrs. McAllister at once took
form for her. She had come to their
wedding, and Gertrude remembered her
as tall, and that her dress and hat became
her. The young, light-minded
bride had remarked the difference between
this guest and other Slocumites.</p>

<p>Kept in state on the buffet downstairs
was a silver pitcher, the sole real
silver in the house. Mrs. McAllister
had sent it to the Warreners as a wedding
present.</p>

<p>Gertrude got up and went out in the
hall. “Eliza!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.” The maid of all work
appeared at the foot of the back stairs.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;just go and get that silver
pitcher off the dining-room buffet and
clean it. I guess it hasn’t been cleaned
for three years.”</p>

<p>The maid looked at her in astonishment.
“Why, we haven’t got a mite of
cleaning powder in the house, Mrs.
Warrener!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener came slowly down
the stairs herself, and, going to the dining-room
buffet, looked at her wedding
gift&mdash;or what she could see of it
through a thick layer of dirt and discoloration.
Then she carried it to the
bathroom, and, with nail brush and
tooth powder, shone it up as well as she
could. It was a tribute of welcome to
the return of the Bellamys.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>After a week or so of the new atmosphere
of the tiny library she
summed up her life as follows, and was
able to state that the routine of her days
never varied: She rose at seven and
dressed. George’s train went at eight,
and she sat with him at table through a
breakfast of hot bread, meat, potatoes
and coffee. Then her husband put on
his coat and hat and took his leave without
even bidding her good-by. She felt
lonely when the butcher and the grocer
had gone. When she had given her directions
to Eliza, it was never more
than ten o’clock. In days past she had
been used to walk out to the library and
get a book, or wander into a neighbor’s
“and sit a while,” but of late there commenced
from the early morning a
period of rocking and reading in the
library. In the evening George returned
from New York only in time to
come to the table without the formality
of washing his hands.</p>

<p>These were her interests. Too timid
to go to Town Club meetings, too simple-minded
to be of any great importance
in the different Slocum circles,
she kept to herself. Her sole interest
would naturally be her husband; him
she saw from seven P.&nbsp;M. to seven
A.&nbsp;M.; or, rather, she slept beside him
during these hours&mdash;for directly after
dinner he would throw himself down on
the lounge in his library and smoke and
read till at nine o’clock she roused him
and sent him to bed in their common
bedroom, in their common bed.</p>

<p>George, tired and devitalized by his
strenuous life, absorbed by his own and
his employer’s affairs, fell asleep at
once. But his companion, more alive
than she knew, would lie awake until
long past midnight, her body unfatigued,
her mind restless, her wakeful
eyes staring into the dark which had
for her no emotion and no mystery.</p>

<p>One afternoon she found she had
read through a whole book without
stopping, and for the first time in her
life had been absorbed. She got up and
turned off the steam heat and opened
the window.</p>

<p>“It must be ninety here with these
radiators! You either freeze or stew.”</p>

<p>The air came in bluffly, its unfriendly
edges met her cheeks; before they
could be refreshed she was cold in her
thin muslin shirt-waist.</p>

<p>She had risen in expression of a sudden
need of air, a sudden sense of
suffocation, but she thought only that
she was “nervous,” and would go out
and take a walk. A little later, a golf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
cape over a short coat of material
known as “covert”&mdash;short-skirted, a
gray felt hat on her head&mdash;Mrs. George
Warrener was seen by her neighbors to
be going “uptown.”</p>

<p>Not until she had left the village,
keeping steady pace up the hill toward
the Golf Club, did she feel that she
had “let off steam.” The quick motion
set free the tension of her nerves, and
she almost forgot the acute sensation
that drove her from the house. At the
golf links she approached the course
and stood by the fence, near to one of
the last bunkers.</p>

<p>The field was sparsely dotted with the
golfers. A red dash in the distance,
a green dash, indicated the players who
bent in bright sweaters over their sticks.
Two men came across the ground close
to her&mdash;strangers&mdash;she saw that instantly,
and regarded them with the
curiosity of a resident. The man who
was playing, his club swung over his
shoulder, his driver in his hand, was
short and stout, with smooth, red
cheeks and bright eyes under shaggy
brows. His shoes were large and
heavy, his golf stockings thick, and his
fustian clothes rough and well made.
His companion, a younger man in a
loose-sleeved overcoat, had a soft felt
hat on his head and a lighted cigar in
his hand. The older man said to him,
laughing:</p>

<p>“There you are, old man! If you’re
really caddying for me, you’ll have to
ferret the ball out of that ditch by the
fence. I saw it roll down.”</p>

<p>The other lazily nodded, took a puff
at his cigar and came over in the direction
indicated. Mrs. Warrener
leaned on the fence watching the gentleman,
who poked about in the grass
with his cane.</p>

<p>“Let me give you a fresh ball out of
my pocket; I’ve got three left,” he
called.</p>

<p>The older man laughed. “Oh, go on,
look for it; it’s right under your nose.
You’ve given me a ‘fresh ball out of
your pocket’ every time one has rolled
fifteen yards!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener stooped down; she
saw the golf ball on the other side of
the fence. She put her hand under
through the railing and picked it up;
she handed it to the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I think this is your ball.”</p>

<p>He took it with a swift, quick look
at her, lifted his hat with cane and
cigar in the same hand and thanked her.
Taking the ball, he returned to his
friend.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener watched the older
gentleman prepare to drive&mdash;then the
two men follow the direction indicated
by the sharp, momentary flight of the
little white ball, the golfer tripping
briskly along, the other dark figure following
slowly. She had never seen
either of them before; who were they?
The distant rattle of an incoming
train&mdash;the one before her husband’s&mdash;warned
her of the time. She would
barely reach home before George came
in. “Although,” she reflected, “I may
just as well be late, for all <i>he</i> will notice,
he is so tired, anyway.”</p>

<p>She walked, nevertheless, mechanically
toward home, so slowly that when
she reached the village street George’s
train had been in some time.</p>

<p>At this time of night a little crowd
was gathered, as a rule, for the trolley,
and Mrs. Warrener decided to take the
car and anticipate her husband’s arrival
by several minutes.</p>

<p>While she stood with the others who
waited, the strangers of the Golf Club
joined the crowd. As the car appeared
the gentleman in the black coat helped
her in and sat opposite her. When he
threw back his coat to get out his fare
from his pocket, she observed that he
wore a gray waistcoat of soft material&mdash;it
looked as though it were “knit,” she
thought, or “worked”&mdash;a bright red tie
and&mdash;unusual elegance among the men
of Slocum&mdash;gloves&mdash;gray gloves, as
soft in color as his waistcoat. Very
much struck by his dress, she ventured,
with a certain timidity, to look him in
the face. The vivid color of his cravat
made him seem very dark; all she could
observe was a dark face, dark mustache
and eyes, for he was looking at her,
and she met his eyes directly. Their
interested curiosity rendered her uncomfortable,
and she removed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
glance, which traveled down the line of
colorless passengers, tired men in dusty,
careless dress; unbrushed derbys, linen
far from immaculate, gloveless hands.
Each man had his bunch of evening papers,
some carried parcels from the city
for suburban use. A woman she knew,
an inveterate shopper, nodded brightly
to her.</p>

<p>“Been in New York all day. Just
too tired. Never saw such a crowd in
the stores; why, I thought I never
<i>would</i> get waited on. Say&mdash;&mdash;” There
was a vacant seat by Mrs. Warrener,
and the lady came over and took it, continuing
a description of bargains, and a
tirade against crowds. “Been up this
week, Gert?”</p>

<p>“No, I hardly ever go in.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a change, but I always say
when we get to Slocum I’m glad I don’t
live in New York, it’s so wearing.
Been up to the Golf Club?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not to play.”</p>

<p>The conversationalist was conscious
of a change in her well-known neighbor’s
tone, an accent, just what it was
she could not imagine, but it was sufficiently
marked to give her food for
thought.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Warrener left the car at her
corner, Mrs. Turnbull puzzled over her.
Perhaps she was offended with her?
But she had no reason for such an idea!
Perhaps George Warrener was losing
money? As money to the unsentimental,
commercial American mind is
the source of all bliss and the cause of
all unhappiness, the slide down which
all spirits fall and the height to which
they rise, she reached a sad conclusion
in this, and dropped her wonderings.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Warrener and his wife arrived at the
same moment on the steps of their two-story
frame house.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said. He took out his
latchkey and entered the door. The
hall was hot and full of the smell of
roasting meat and soup herbs. The
dinner puffed out to meet the diners
with damp, pungent warmth. George
put his batch of papers down on the
hall stand.</p>

<p>“Well,” he repeated, absently, took
off his dusty derby, hung it up and got
out of his overcoat.</p>

<p>He looked for no response to his
greeting. Mrs. Warrener understood
this, and made none.</p>

<p>Warrener went upstairs to his study.</p>

<p>“Gracious, Gert, some one’s left the
window open in my den! It’s like ice
here!”</p>

<p>“It’ll get hot enough. Turn on the
steam.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener followed her husband
upstairs into the cold little room. The
smell of stale smoke seemed to have
frozen on the air, but over it the smell
of the cigar the gentleman had smoked,
a peculiar aroma, as new to her, as delicious,
as would have been a priceless
perfume, came to her nostrils. She
went to her chair where she had sat
for hours reading, and picked up her
book, which she kept in her hand.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing all day,
Gert?” he asked at dinner, after he had
eaten his tepid soup and drunk an entire
glass of ice water.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know&mdash;nothing much.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’? Well, you are in
luck! I feel as if something was doin’
in every inch of my body. I’m tired
out. Harkweather kept the clerks
down to-night&mdash;they won’t get out before
nine o’clock; but I said ‘not tonight
for me. I’m goin’ home.’ And
I’m goin’ right to bed. I guess I’ll
sleep twelve hours, all right!”</p>

<p>As they went upstairs, he first and
she slowly following, she suggested:</p>

<p>“How would you like me to sleep in
the spare room, if you’re so tired?”</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked, jocularly. “Do I
snore so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s not it. It may feel
good to have the whole bed to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe it would.”</p>

<p>In the spare room, close to the
springs, on a narrow, single bed, Mrs.
Warrener crept alone. She drew the
adjusting electric light close to her and
took her book up again to re-read, her
elbow in the pillow and her cheek on
her hand. She followed the printed
lines with dawning interest on her face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and a growing intelligence, until all
of a sudden the dead stillness of the
hour and time struck her. The fireless
room&mdash;for there was no steam heat in
it&mdash;gave her a chill. She put out the
light and drew the coverlet about her
and settled down to sleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The business interest of which George
Warrener formed a humble part had no
picturesque traditions. Like everything
else in New York, the corporation had
even during Warrener’s time boasted
several different addresses. When especial
advantages presented themselves
in the shape of higher buildings and
higher rent, Harkweather &amp; Fulsome
moved. The unstableness, the constant
transition, had an effect upon him which
he did not appreciate. Warrener, with
his firm, was restless; and restless with
his eighty million fellow Americans.</p>

<p>Harkweather &amp; Fulsome’s last move
had been to a twenty-two-floored steel
structure, from whose tenth story were
visible the roofs of the buildings not
yet razed to make room for other giant
office honeycombs. Money, at Harkweather
&amp; Fulsome’s, superseded everything
else in the world, extinguished
the lights of pleasure, destroyed even
the capacity to enjoy. Everything else
was crowded out of the question. Harkweather
&amp; Fulsome were “strictly business,”
strictly getters of wealth; and
they squeezed dry every sponge that
came to their hands.</p>

<p>Warrener, in the office, had drifted
into the position of confidential clerk,
very much used when wanted, and
shifted off into a little, stuffy room,
where he had a desk and typewriter,
when his services were not in active demand.
Here he copied, filed and noted;
added, opened and docketed mail; and
read the financial news in every available
sheet in the city. To his own thinking,
he was an authority on stocks and
bonds. He heard innumerable tips
thrown out; saw them acted upon, and
prove either valuable or worthless; followed
the rise and fall of fortunes near
and far; assisted at failures and successes;
and during the hours of his
routine in the office had the sensation
of being himself a millionaire! But
when he left the ferry, the bondholders
and “big men” hurried to their more
important trains and more important
stations, and Warrener hustled himself,
with his evening papers, into the short
train of the Slocum local, he then distinctly
felt the difference between his
bank balance and his chief’s! He lived
in the atmosphere of money, but he had
never been ambitious. Of average intelligence,
common school education,
steady-going and trustworthy, he had
no intentions further than to pay his
bills, earn his salary and keep at the
business.</p>

<p>Were he asked what part of his life
he recalled with most pleasure he would
have unhesitatingly answered: “Getting
engaged and going on our honeymoon.”
The sentimental period&mdash;which
had come into his unimaginative
life with the imperiousness of that passion
which at least once during a man’s
life changes his existence for a time,
short or long&mdash;had for Warrener left
behind it a memory which the cares of
the world, the moth and rust of vulgar
routine, trains and ferries, quick
lunches and elevators, common surroundings
and abasing ideals, overlaid
but never destroyed.</p>

<p>Eight years before he had asked the
prettiest girl he knew to marry him, and
she had said yes. His vacation falling
at this time, they had spent two weeks
in August at Far Rockaway, and from
there went directly into the rented
house on Grand Street, and the newly
married man began his bi-daily pilgrimages
on the train.</p>

<p>He would have been ashamed to have
anyone, above all his wife, know that as
he crossed the ferry, one of a thick-packed
crowd on the front part of the
boat, standing there close to the running
waters, near the bow, he often
gave himself a mental holiday; then the
image of Gertrude in a pinkish dress
and picture hat came to his mind as he
had seen her on the boardwalk at Rockaway
eight years ago. It was a species
of revel for him to recall those days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
He was not unhappy or even discontented;
he was too commonplace to be
capable of either sensation. He was
numbed, pinched hard by life.</p>

<p>“I am indispensable to Mr. Harkweather,”
he repeated, with pride, and
passed the time with his hand on other
people’s grindstones, all the gold dust
flying into other people’s bags.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>One especial Sunday he awakened after
a refreshing sleep, stretched his
arms and yawned aloud, then lay pleasantly
conscious of the well-being of his
condition&mdash;half asleep still, and it was
far into the morning! Belowstairs he
could hear the heavy footsteps of Eliza,
and fancied the early presage of dinner.
Warrener listened, knowing he should
soon hear another footstep lighter than
that of the maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>“Gert!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener came in.</p>

<p>“It’s twelve o’clock,” she said, “and
you’ll just about have time to get up,
take your bath and dress for dinner.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he responded, cheerfully,
but did not move. Instead, putting his
hands up behind his head, he watched
his wife as she fetched out his clean
clothes and laid them with his Sunday
suit over a chair. As she moved quietly
about the room, the man’s feeling of
content grew, added to by the feminine
presence and the evidence of care
and wifely attention. The little room
was bright with the sunshine of a mild
November day. The chromos, the glaring
wall paper, the cheap oak bedroom
set, the thin lace curtains touched with
the light, appeared lovely in their master’s
eyes. Before him was the prospect
of a long day of repose, spent in
perfect, tranquil laziness, a day in the
fresh country air. There would be no
office or telegraph calls, no duties, no
sounds to disturb the hard-earned
hours. His relaxed nerves and body
rejoiced in the holiday. He was as
happy as he could ever be&mdash;did he know
it, would ever be. Years afterward
Warrener looked back at that especial
Sunday with something of the same affection
he bestowed upon his marriage
memories, and with keener regret.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Warrener went out of the
room, he called her:</p>

<p>“Say, Gert!”</p>

<p>She paused at the door, clean towels
in her hand. She was going to get his
bath ready.</p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>He wanted to call: “Give me a kiss.”
But her manner rather distanced him.
So he said: “What’ll you give me if
I guess what we’re going to have for
dinner?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she laughed. “I should
think anybody with a nose would know.
Eliza leaves the kitchen door open all
the time.”</p>

<p>“It smells good,” he sniffed. “And
it’s away ahead of sandwiches and a
glass of beer; that’s my noon meal, as a
rule.”</p>

<p>She warned him he wouldn’t get any
dinner at all if he didn’t hurry up, and
in a few moments he heard the running
of his bath; the sound, to his good
humor and contented frame of mind,
was one more pleasant, luxurious,
agreeable part of the day.</p>

<p>Later, shaved and washed, dressed
with great precision and care, he sat in
the parlor, the multitudinous sheets of
the New York daily papers around him.</p>

<p>Gertrude rocked idly in the window,
her eyes on the deserted street. Eliza
washed the dinner dishes and put them
rattling away, then tramped up the front
stairs, and in gorgeous magnificence
went out the back way, emerging into
Grand Street. At the sight of her Mrs.
Warrener said: “I’m going to give
you a cold supper, George, some salad
and tea&mdash;she’s made biscuits, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. It seems as if
we only just got up from dinner.” He
threw his paper down. “Want to take
a walk, Gert? It’s nice out, and I don’t
think it’s cold.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, indifferently, “I’ll
get my hat and coat.”</p>

<p>When she came down Warrener had
been walking about his tiny parlor and
dining room, and was still under the
spell of householder and in love with
his possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve got the McAllister wedding
present cleaned up fine.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only real silver we’ve got; it
makes the other things look common.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener regarded the display
on her buffet with some discontent.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” returned the
husband. “It’s as good as you can get
anywhere for the money.”</p>

<p>“The McAllisters have come back to
Slocum,” his wife mentioned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he nodded. “Mrs. McAllister
used to go to Uncle Samson’s church.
I don’t see why you shouldn’t go up
there to call some day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener had opened the front
door and gone out on the stoop; George,
getting into his overcoat, followed her.
Side by side they went slowly down the
front steps of the little wooden stoop.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t know what to say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll say it all; besides, perhaps
she’ll be out&mdash;leave a card&mdash;got one of
mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>As they turned into Grand Street and
hesitated a moment as to their direction,
Warrener suggested:</p>

<p>“Might as well walk along up toward
the McAllister place; it’s as good a
walk as any.”</p>

<p>As they started off in the fresh, crisp
air, refreshing and sweet to the man’s
nostrils, stimulating and revivifying after
his close confined days, a sudden
impulse to have the woman by his side
nearer him overcame him; he drew her
arm through his.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk arm in arm, like old
married couples.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Warrener held back and
took her arm away.</p>

<p>“No,” she demurred; “I think it’s
common.”</p>

<p>In the following days Mrs. Warrener
took up her life, or, more accurately,
began it, standing on the threshold
of an abyss&mdash;the flight of steps before
her that led to the new. As she had
never been particularly interested in
anything, she did not know that she
was an invalid with a fatal malady, a
malady whose term is too commonly
employed by people whose reason for
the state is less apparent than this
woman’s in a country town. She had
never heard the word “boredom” used.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen village
friends of Mrs. Warrener’s whose
status was on a higher plane than hers,
whose houses had more square feet of
land around them, whose “help” was
more efficient. In their parlors now and
then she took an inadequate hand at
euchre, and of late she had been trying
to learn bridge. These ladies made the
town library and the little hospital, the
Children’s Home and the church interests,
run more or less smoothly; they
had a hundred busy, useful interests.
They were good wives and good mothers
and good citizens. She had never
heard any of them use the verb “to be
bored,” and if she had, she would not
have known what it meant! She suffered
under a complaint which, like
many maladies, is less fatal so long as it
has no name; but the disease was too
acute to be ignored. It had engendered
too many complications.</p>

<p>At the town library the librarian from
among the rows of school books one day
handed down to Mrs. Warrener a
French dictionary. From the novel
she had read a few days before she
had copied out this phrase:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Ennui</i> is like the unseen worm in the
wood, that slowly gnaws the good, clean
substance until his parasite presence is declared
by innumerable interstices that finally
destroy the wood and proclaim it rotten to
the fiber&mdash;<i>ennui</i> had eaten into her, devoured
her. There was not one inch of her
that did not ache from desuetude, from
moral inertia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gertrude found the word “<i>ennui</i>”
in the dictionary, and the following definition:
“Listlessness, languor, tedium,
lassitude, tiresomeness,” compared it
with her scrap of paper, puzzled her
pretty brows until their lines looked like
pain. As she put up the book and left
the library, she said to herself: “Well,
I guess that’s what’s the matter with
me.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>When Slocum was scarcely a village
Edward McAllister, after his retirement
from the Supreme Court, purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
sufficient land in the State to establish
a model farm. Here his children,
Paul and Agnes, were born, and
before they had time to know they were
Americans McAllister accepted a foreign
embassy and lived with his family
abroad until his death. His daughter,
Agnes, had married in Rome, and after
a few years of wandering and continental
life, with her husband, Mr. John
Bellamy, and her brother, Mr. Paul
McAllister, she returned to Slocum.</p>

<p>They had come back in order that
Mrs. Bellamy should see just how much
she could stand of American life and
manners; in order that their children
might have enough of their native soil
on their hands as they played, and
enough of its education in their heads,
to entitle them to the self-sufficiency of
American citizens.</p>

<p>Little Bellamy was immured in Groton,
hard at the American part of it,
and Mrs. Bellamy sat this morning in a
charming room furnished in Colonial
style: continental taste and the accessories
that make living a luxury
and pleasure combined to make her a
charming environment. Mrs. Bellamy
was teaching her little daughter the
gentle art of making a long rope of
useless wool by means of a spool and a
row of pins.</p>

<p>The mother’s head bent close to the
little girl’s was as golden as the child’s.
Her hands, with their flashing rings,
played in and out among the pins with
a skill nothing short of miraculous in
the eyes of the little girl, who took up
the spool between her own tiny fingers,
the worsted twisted hard around her
thumb.</p>

<p>By the table, in a luxurious leather
chair, the other occupant of the room
was almost lost to sight. His presence
was, however, indicated by the film of
cigarette smoke that rose curlingly
around his head. The yellow cover of
a French novel was just visible above
the table.</p>

<p>“Paul,” his sister asked him, “how
do you like America?”</p>

<p>“<i>America?</i>” he repeated, and, although
he said no more, she knew by
his quizzical drawl what he meant.</p>

<p>“Well, Slocum, then, and the old
place?”</p>

<p>“Immensely!”</p>

<p>“Absurd,” she laughed. “You have
only been here a week, and except for
ridiculously caddying a couple of times
for John at the Golf Club, you have not
been out of the house.”</p>

<p>“In which case, how could I fail to
like it?” he said, with mock politeness.
“You’ve kept me company! <i>You</i> don’t
seem to be tempted to explore the old
scenes any more than I do! Perhaps,
like me, you’re afraid of the shock. You
know how luxurious I am. If it were
not for the extremely swell gentleman
and lady servants, I should feel very
much at ease.” He had not put down
his book; he still smoked and appeared
to be reading what he said from it. “I
was most amused the other day as I
stood on the piazza; did John tell you?
I saw going around the road two very
attractive-looking girls&mdash;they recalled
the Gibson pictures as much as anything
else. They wore, of course, short
skirts and those bodices that you see
everywhere. They had a bicycle, each
of them, and they were walking along,
their arms around each other’s waists.
I said to John: ‘By Jove, what a stunning
pair of girls! I should like to
know them.’ And he said: ‘They are
living in the same house with you, my
dear fellow&mdash;<i>they are my cook and my
laundress</i>.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy laughed appreciatively.
“Tell me, Paul, how <i>does</i> America
strike you?”</p>

<p>McAllister reluctantly laid his book
down, crossed his legs and prepared to
answer.</p>

<p>“I’ve been out more often than you
think. I took a turtle view of the
town; I mean I sauntered up and down
it and out of it, and it gave me as complete
a sensation as I have had in
twenty-four years. A better sensation,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma chère</i>, and I am not likely to have
another.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy listened, as she always
did when her brother gave himself the
trouble to speak more than one sentence
at a time to any woman with
whom he was not in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>“It is all new-born, honorable, progressive
and decent. Everybody seems
to have a certain disdain for me. I believe
it is because, if you will permit me
to say so, I dress so well.”</p>

<p>His sister laughed.</p>

<p>“Not that <i>they</i> do not dress well!
They do&mdash;astoundingly well; but they
all dress alike, and you cannot tell, as
in the case of your own servant, a lady
from her cook, or a butcher boy on a
holiday from the millionaire’s son, if he
happens to come through town on foot
or in a motor. Let’s agree, then, that
I do look different. ‘The drug-store
man’&mdash;that’s what you call him, isn’t
it?&mdash;looked at me as if he hated me and
my clothes when he gave me some calisaya.
He thought I was a foreigner;
they don’t like foreigners. If anything
could put me on the same footing with
my country people, this town street did,
as far as it was able. By the time I got
to the grocery I had forgotten that I
had not seen America for thirty years,
and that I was so different. Nothing
remained but that <i>country school feeling</i>,
that boy feeling. If you ask what
I mean: There was a barrel of apples
outside of the grocer’s door. I wanted
to sneak one! I would have given fifty
dollars for a glass of cider&mdash;for anything,
in short, to keep up the game. I
went in and asked him if he had such a
thing as ‘sarsaparilla.’ He had it, and,
in spite of my ‘difference,’ he pulled his
cork and I drank the whole glass of that
stuff. Pah! don’t ask me about it! It
was all right, I don’t doubt; but when I
left the corner and started up the hill,
that wonderful sentimental feeling had
entirely left me! There was only a
wretched nausea&mdash;a complete sense of
how far away I had gone from the simplicity
of the whole thing, and I don’t
say that I congratulated myself. Now,
will you let me read, Agnes?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bellamy had turned to a
servant who entered with a card&mdash;with
two cards. “‘Mr. and Mrs. Warrener,’”
she read aloud. “Oh, dear me,
have you let them in?”</p>

<p>It appeared there was only a lady:
“Mrs. George Warrener.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! I suppose that a lot of
these people will call, and I must be
more or less civil. Show Mrs. Warrener
in&mdash;there is time to escape for
you, Paul, by way of the dining room.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>The brightness of the room, the effect
produced by the brilliant color of the
decorations, and the atmosphere of livableness
and charm did not dazzle the
guest who entered&mdash;because she simply
could not see! Her excitement was
such that it caused a sort of blindness
to fall on her, although she had never
thought herself bashful or shy.</p>

<p>A lady, younger than herself, rose
and welcomed her in a soft, quick voice,
with a difference so marked in speech
to any Mrs. Warrener had ever heard
that she thought it was a foreign accent.</p>

<p>“How do you do? This is very good
of you; won’t you sit here? We feel
very much like strangers, coming back
to Slocum after so many years. Fanny,
darling, take your spools and wool and
go to nurse. There&mdash;first say: ‘How
do you do?’ to Mrs. Warrener.”</p>

<p>Gertrude had a vision of a small
creature with a head like a chrysanthemum
flower and the wide, round eyes
of a child. The little hand that met her
glove with frank politeness gave her
a pretty greeting. Mrs. Warrener was
obliged to break the hard tension of
nervous fright that clutched her throat,
and to speak to her hostess, who, in a
chair near her, represented a world of
civilization and education so unlike her
own that a bird of paradise and a barnyard
hen might have had more points
in common.</p>

<p>She breathed out: “I used to know
Mrs. McAllister; she used to go to my
husband’s uncle’s church.” There was
no elder lady present, and Mrs. Warrener
looked for one.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” her hostess answered. “I
am very sorry my mother is not here.
She is at Cannes; she never comes north
before spring. It is nearly twelve years
since she’s been in America.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Warrener was forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
speak. “I guess it was just at the
time of my wedding. That was eight
years ago. I remember they said she
was going to Europe then. She came
to my wedding; she was at the
church.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy, who keenly, although
with perfect politeness, was studying
the village lady before her, wondered
very much for what reason her mother
had attended the Warrener wedding.</p>

<p>“Slocum must seem small after
Rome,” Mrs. Warrener ventured into
the conversation with more ease.</p>

<p>Her hostess laughed. “Slocum!
Why, I haven’t seen it yet, do you
know! I came at night&mdash;we drove up
from the train in a storm. But”&mdash;she
raised her eyes to the other part of the
room&mdash;“my brother can tell you how it
seems; <i>he</i> has lots of ideas about it!
My brother, Mr. McAllister&mdash;Mrs.
Warrener.”</p>

<p>Paul McAllister had returned, to his
sister’s great surprise.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Warrener thinks Slocum must
seem ‘small’ after Rome.” She did not
italicize the repetition which she carefully
made, sure that it would appeal to
her brother’s humor as it was.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mrs. Warrener gracefully, if unnecessarily,
rose to the presentation, and
found her hand in that of the gentleman
of the long black overcoat, who
bowed, meeting her eyes with a smile
very like one of recognition and friendliness.</p>

<p>“Slocum is not small to me. I was
born and brought up here. The place
one comes from always seems the most
important in the world. Of course it
may strike me as small before I get
through with it, but I have not found
it so yet.”</p>

<p>Entirely unable to cope with the conversation,
ordinary as it was, carried
on by the quick, soft voices in
enunciation so new to her that the language
seemed scarcely English&mdash;Mrs.
Warrener looked at the speaker with
less embarrassment because he put her
at her ease. Dark, brilliant and distinguished,
he did not, nevertheless, awe
her as did Mrs. Bellamy’s beauty and
pose. McAllister took a chair and sat
down directly in front of the guest.</p>

<p>“I have seen Mrs. Warrener already&mdash;at
golf. You were there yesterday?
Didn’t you give me my ball?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I just walked up for a little exercise.
It’s nice playing there in the
afternoon now, since the snow has
gone.”</p>

<p>“I don’t play, myself,” McAllister
said, “but, as you say, it’s a nice walk.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy, after a word or two,
leaned back in her chair with relief,
and left to her brother the amenities,
watching him and the guest.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Warrener had gone&mdash;and
McAllister had seen her to the door and
returned with his indolent step&mdash;as he
stopped to light a fresh cigarette, his
sister said:</p>

<p>“Well, had you any recollection about
a village beauty such as your boyhood
and sarsaparilla memories? And did
Mrs. Warrener recall it&mdash;and is the result
the same?”</p>

<p>McAllister turned his handsome,
careless face to his sister.</p>

<p>“You think her a stupid little provincial,
don’t you, Agnes?”</p>

<p>“I? Why, I asked you your opinion.”</p>

<p>“You don’t deny that you think that.”</p>

<p>“Her boots are frightful, and her
hat was appalling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come,” laughed her brother;
“be fair!”</p>

<p>Mrs. McAllister gathered up her
work&mdash;a piece of tapestry.</p>

<p>“You are unable,” she said, with
some asperity, “to see any landscape
without a woman in it, even for five
days.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great compliment that you pay
your sex. Let my weakness pass.
Won’t you confess that this little village
nobody has more good looks than we
have seen in Rome for two winters?”</p>

<p>“Beauty&mdash;<i>Paul!</i>”</p>

<p>McAllister shrugged: “Decidedly. A
face like a Greuze, perfect eyebrows&mdash;so
perfect as to be almost suspicious;
that inimitable droop of the eyes and
the corners of the mouth&mdash;at once
childlike and mature; and her coloring!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>“You are always finding the most
impossible women, and telling me how
paintable they are. Do you want to
paint this little bore?”</p>

<p>“Somebody has painted her, and to
perfection,” he said, with authority. “I
will show you her likeness in the
Louvre when we get back.”</p>

<p>He had thrust his hands in his pockets
and begun to stroll up and down
the room. As she watched him a shade
crossed his sister’s face. The worsted
ball Fanny had let fall her mother
picked up and turned over in her hands.</p>

<p>“As you sat and talked to the poor
little woman I watched you; she was
fascinated by you&mdash;no, really! Her entire
expression altered! She has never
seen anyone like you before.” (“That’s
what the drug-store man thought,”
murmured McAllister.) “And I hope
she won’t take to frequenting the Golf
Club and other local festive places
where she can see you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Agnes.”</p>

<p>McAllister laughed, and, taking from
her hands the red worsted ball, idly
unwound it.</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish! If we are here for
any purpose under heaven, let’s amuse
ourselves and some of these people, too!
I don’t intend to shut myself up like
Noah in the ark, with only the passengers
I took on board at Rome. Let’s
have Mrs. Warrener to lunch; she’s a
nice little creature; she’s immured in
this hole, and she’s probably bored to
death.”</p>

<p>“If she <i>is</i> immured,” murmured Mrs.
Bellamy, “don’t let’s bring her out.”</p>

<p>McAllister had almost unwound the
ball as he talked, and what was left of
it rolled down under the table.</p>

<p>Here Bellamy came in, and McAllister
took his indolent self away. “What
have you been doing?” Mr. Bellamy
asked his wife. She gathered up the
worsted and said, impatiently: “I’ve
been talking to my idle and destructive
brother.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>It was six by the time Mrs. Warrener
reached her own door. The aspect of
Grand Street had changed. In the early
twilight of the November afternoon the
wooden houses bordering her street
stood out clear-cut and fearlessly ugly.
All the Felter children were playing in
the yard, their piercing screams over
their games of pleasure welcomed her
ears. The little things, with red tam-o’-shanters
on their heads, tore about
hither and thither, calling in loud, penetrating
voices.</p>

<p>Fanny Bellamy had said, “How do
you do, Mrs. Wawenner,” in a voice
like an angel bird’s. As Gertrude went
up her steps she saw the <i>Slocum Daily</i>
on the mat. Usually she seized upon
the paper eagerly, but to-night she did
not even lift it from the stoop.</p>

<p>In answer to the bell, the maid-of-all-work,
Eliza, ran to the door. It was
washday, and she exuded soapsuds.
In her uncombed and dusty hair, little
flakes of soapsuds still clung; she wore
a gingham apron, with which she wiped
her steaming face as she let her mistress
in. For the first time Mrs. Warrener
saw Eliza with eyes from which
the scales of custom had fallen, and the
cordial smile extended by one maid’s
mistress who is conscious that she is
just so little better because she has as
much to spend a week as the maid has
a month, did not this evening light the
lady’s face.</p>

<p>“Eliza, never go to the door again
without a white apron.”</p>

<p>The woman stared blankly, and her
silent astonishment further aggravated
the mistress.</p>

<p>“And fix your hair,” she said, severely,
“and keep the kitchen door shut.”</p>

<p>Dinner smells which for years unremarked
had greeted Mrs. Warrener’s
nostrils, odors of kitchen and soapsuds,
sickened her to-night; but before she
could turn to go upstairs her attention
was forcibly called to account by Eliza,
who, with arms akimbo, cried to her:</p>

<p>“If you ain’t satisfied with me, Mrs.
Warrener, you can get another girl.
I ain’t no common, ordinary servant to
be spoke to like that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener turned about at the
lower stair. “What are you, then?”
she asked, sharply.</p>

<p>The woman drew a breath of rage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“<i>What am I?</i>” she shrieked. “Why,
I’m <i>help</i>, that’s what I am! And I’ve
got better clothes than you have upstairs.”</p>

<p>“You can go and put them on,” her
mistress said, “and get another place.”</p>

<p>Too excited to realize what the predicament
of being without a servant
meant in a suburban town, Gertrude did
nothing to propitiate, and Eliza left.</p>

<p>From the opposite windows the
neighbors watched the departure with
astonishment and much interest, for
Eliza had been with the Warreners
eight years. Her red face shone under
her feathered hat at the hack window,
and her eyes, when flaming passion was
subdued, were full of tears.</p>

<p>As Gertrude, indifferently, and without
a word of good-by, paid her her
money, Eliza sniffled: “I’d of liked to
say good-by to Mr. Warrener&mdash;<i>he’s</i> a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>When he came in finally to a dinner
kept hot on the stove for him, and
served by his wife, she informed him:</p>

<p>“I’ve sent Eliza away.” He was
stupefied, and could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! What for?”</p>

<p>“She was impertinent.”</p>

<p>Too amazed to speak, he ate his soup
in silence; saying at length, sympathetically:
“You’ll have to go up to
town to-morrow and get somebody.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, Gerty. It will
be work for you, and it’s no easy job
to get servants for the country, especially
general houseworkers.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” she agreed, meditatively.
But the idea of going to town
was an excitement to her for the first
time, and she had a scheme already in
her mind. If she could find them she
would get a cook and laundress and
an upstairs girl. She would economize
somehow or other, and she guessed
George wouldn’t mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>The stagnant pool of Slocum was
very considerably stirred by New York
during the days when Mrs. Warrener
was obliged to go in and out to look
for her servants. For she had decided
that Eliza should be replaced by two
maids, one of whom should be dressed
in apron and caps such as those worn
by the trim person of whom she had
caught a glimpse as she waited in Mrs.
Bellamy’s drawing room.</p>

<p>When her husband came home one
night, Gertrude was waiting for him in
the window. She had had a hard day.
Timid and abashed before the new and
autocratic ladies for whom she felt no
room in the house was good enough,
she had vacillated on the verge of temper
and tears. One of her characteristics
was the complete control of her
features and a passive exterior which
hitherto no excitements had disturbed.</p>

<p>“George”&mdash;she drew her husband
into the parlor&mdash;“I’ve got two girls.”
She put her hand on the lapel of the
overcoat he had as yet not taken off.</p>

<p>“<i>Two</i> girls!” he echoed.</p>

<p>She was flushed and pretty&mdash;very
pretty. He vaguely thought she was
dressed up more than usual.</p>

<p>“I’m tired out!” she exclaimed.
“Those intelligence offices are enough
to wear you to death. I got two because&mdash;the
work here is too much for
any one girl.”</p>

<p>George looked around the microscopic
room, and mentally saw, as well,
the microscopic second floor.</p>

<p>“Eliza got through all right.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener exclaimed: “Don’t
talk to me of Eliza. She wasn’t fit to
be seen.”</p>

<p>With the hope that the two servants
together might not cost as much as one,
he asked:</p>

<p>“What’s their wages?”</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Why, I’d rather make it up some
way&mdash;on a dress or a hat. They’re
high. One twenty and the other twenty-five
a month.”</p>

<p>“Gee whizz!” Warrener staggered
back. “Why,” he gasped, “you’re
<i>crazy</i>, Gert!”</p>

<p>Her hand fell back from the lapel
of his coat. Tears of vexation and fatigue
sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Hush! <i>She’s</i> there, in the dining
room&mdash;she’ll hear you. I’m <i>not</i> crazy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
I’m sick of living like a tenement
house.”</p>

<p>The master was prevented from
saying anything further by the entrance
of a pert-faced girl in cap and
apron, who said briskly:</p>

<p>“Dinner’s served.”</p>

<p>Standing there in Eliza’s place between
the cheap portières, she represented
a convulsion in the clerk’s household.
He had never been thus invited
to a meal in his own house before. He
got off his coat and followed his wife
in to dinner.</p>

<p>The little, cozy room possessed for
the first time an element of unrest. In
eight years it had not altered so much
as this. At first Gertrude, with a washerwoman,
did her own work; then
Eliza came blithely and good-humoredly
on the scene. She had grown to be
like a friend. Warrener liked her. In
her oven, which she had at length triumphantly
overcome, she baked him
certain favorite little breads much to
his taste. She ironed his collars and
shirts “just right.” He could say to
her:</p>

<p>“Look here, Eliza, just run down
to Pearce’s and get me a couple of
cigars.” He could never order this
bustling individual in cap and gown in
this manner. “A tenement!” The
word touched his contented pride in his
little household; already the golden
sunlight was beginning to slip from
the wall. Change and progression
were following the tired man close on
his heels to his very door.</p>

<p>A fortnight went by after her call
at the house on the hill before the
event reverently hoped for by George
Warrener’s wife transpired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy in her French automobile
drove up Grand Street and
called on Mrs. Warrener.</p>

<p>Gertrude was out, and when she
came home and found the bit of pasteboard
lying on the hatstand and realized
that Mrs. Bellamy had been&mdash;and
had gone!&mdash;a feeling of desolation
swept over her such as might attack a
lonely occupant of a desert island on
rushing to his island’s edge to see a ship
slip over the horizon.</p>

<p>The disappointed woman could think
of nothing to follow this occurrence, no
future after it. She felt deserted and
very miserable.</p>

<p>The waitress who answered the bell
her mistress rang appeared now to be
superfluous&mdash;the extravagance this
splurge represented occurred to Gertrude
for the first time. What was the
good of the servants after Mrs. Bellamy
had been and gone! Since Mrs. Bellamy
would never come again, Eliza
might just as well be there with her
blowzy hair, her blue apron and her
kind, smiling face. Gertrude felt a
homesickness for her as excitement died
out of her limited sky.</p>

<p>Katy’s manner was less flaunting and
insolent than usual. Mrs. Bellamy in
her handsome clothes and the automobile
had impressed her.</p>

<p>“When did the lady come?”</p>

<p>“About half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Was there anyone else?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener would not let herself
think just who there might have been.</p>

<p>“There was only a little girl in the
motor car.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t leave any message?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Well, it was all over, and she might
as well make the best of it. She had
got on all right enough before the Bellamys
came; she guessed she could live
without them, anyhow. She would keep
the girls till George’s summer vacation,
and then they could get another place.
That this provision would leave them
stranded in a bad season did not disturb
her.</p>

<p>She “just couldn’t” go upstairs to indolently
sit down and contemplate at
once the stupid days to be! There were
George’s socks to mend, but she turned
about where she stood, gratefully remembering
that there was also the
meeting of a card club of which she
was a member. It would at least keep
her doing something, and she went out
again and started toward Mrs. Turnbull’s.</p>

<p>Her feet were clad in shoes then in
vogue, with thick, projecting soles and
stubby ends. As her foot was ridiculously
small, it looked less like a man’s&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
masculinity it seems this heavy
gear is intended to simulate&mdash;than like
a sturdy little boy’s. Her short-length
skirt showed a slender ankle in coarse
black stockings, the skirt itself falling
smoothly on her rounded hips; her coat
lay smoothly across a flat back and
shoulders, the small, supple waist was
held in by a leather belt. Her collar,
neither stiff enough nor high enough
to be “smart,” was low enough to leave
visible the back of her neck and the
close growth of her hair. Men have
been known more than once to follow
a woman for the charm of the nape of
her neck; that soft, pretty turn, the
lovely part of the form where the head
with more or less beauty&mdash;according to
type&mdash;joins the shoulder and body.</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Warrener was within
two blocks of her destination, she heard
some one walking fast behind her, and
not unnaturally turned to see who followed
her with a step so decided in the
lonely street.</p>

<p>It was Mr. McAllister.</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of this appearance
on the afternoon when she had
given up the idea of coming in contact
with his like and circle again&mdash;the fact
of meeting him in the open street,
where there was no one but himself to
critically observe her manner&mdash;gave her
a shock of pleasure. She stammered:
“How do you do?” and held out her
hand to him with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gaucherie</i> of a
child.</p>

<p>“What a dreadfully fast walker you
are!” McAllister was out of breath.
“And it’s not the first time I’ve noticed
it. You don’t know how I ran down
the hill behind you that night at the
Golf Club.”</p>

<p>He had never spoken to such a painful
blush before, as surprise and flattered
pleasure deepened in the woman’s
cheeks.</p>

<p>“It’s a splendid speed,” he approved,
“and it’s given you a most glorious
color.”</p>

<p>As he walked along by her side she
managed to say:</p>

<p>“Your sister called to day, and I was
out.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” he exclaimed heartily.
“She will be so sorry. She wanted
to take you out in the automobile&mdash;I
lent it for the purpose. Where are you
going, and at such a pace&mdash;may I
know?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to a card party at Mrs.
Turnbull’s&mdash;it’s right here.”</p>

<p>Her companion showed plainly his
disappointment. “I thought you were
out for a good walk, and that perhaps
I might join you.”</p>

<p>More sorry than he, and thoroughly
regretting having told her stupid errand,
she slowed her pace.</p>

<p>“Can’t I come in with you&mdash;and play
as well?”</p>

<p>She smiled nervously. “Oh, no, there
are only ladies in the club.”</p>

<p>“Only!” he repeated. “What better
could one want? But I should prefer
it in the singular. Can’t you seriously
take me in under your protection and
introduce me? What do you play?
Bridge? I can play bridge. It would
amuse me hugely.” He saw that she
did not understand his use of the word
and changed it. “Entertain me&mdash;do,
please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrener had not much imagination,
but she could imagine the faces
of Mrs. Turnbull and her fellow club
members at the sight of Mr. McAllister
and herself together under any circumstances.
He looked so tall&mdash;so
laughing and at ease&mdash;his attitude as if
he had known her all his life bewildered
her; her embarrassment was not yet
relieved, although her pleasure was
growing.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I couldn’t, Mr. McAllister.”</p>

<p>“Do you like cards?” he demanded,
with abrupt change of topic.</p>

<p>“Not much; I don’t play well.”</p>

<p>“I hate them, personally,” he admitted.
“Why, then, do you go?”</p>

<p>As she made him wait for an answer
he urged: “It’s a crime to sacrifice this
afternoon in a hot, stuffy room before
a lot of painted pasteboards. I don’t
believe they expect you&mdash;do they?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe they do. I don’t
often go. I just pay fines all the time.”</p>

<p>“Pay one this once, won’t you? Is
this the house? Why, it’s a box, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
more. Don’t go and be shut up in
it!”</p>

<p>Gertrude thought with a pang that
Mrs. Turnbull’s was twice as large as
her own house&mdash;she had envied her.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to show me one of
the walks around here? There must
be lots of nice tramps. It will do you
good.”</p>

<p>She had never been spoken to in her
life like this before. Strange as it may
seem, it is, nevertheless, true that she
had never exchanged half a dozen words
with any man but her husband in her life&mdash;that
is, any man save the tradespeople,
whom she always talked to as long
as she could. She had once acknowledged
to herself: “I guess I like men
better than women&mdash;I’d rather talk to
the grocer than to any of the stupid
Slocum women. It’s common of me,
but it’s true.”</p>

<p>McAllister’s voice was like a cradle&mdash;she
seemed to rock in it.</p>

<p>“He’s perfectly elegant,” she said to
herself; “so handsome and polite.”</p>

<p>She would have suffocated at the
Turnbulls’; the same atmosphere that
had latterly pervaded all of her own
surroundings began to surround the
unoffending little house whose porch
and front gate were reached.</p>

<p>She nerved herself to look up at Mr.
McAllister, and with some assurance
met his smiling eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll go along a little further; there’s
a pretty walk over along the old Lackawanna
Station.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>When she turned into Grand Street
at nearly six o’clock she scarcely knew
whether it was her own gate through
which she passed or whether the house
was in its right place or had vanished
with the old associations; whether she
walked up the wooden steps to a familiar
door or floated on air to the portal
of a castle in Spain.</p>

<p>Warrener had telephoned that he
would not be home before midnight;
she received the message with relief, although
the name sounded with as much
indifference to her as though she heard
it for the first time that night.</p>

<p>She sat musing over her dinner, ate
a little of it, left the table as soon as
she could, and restlessly wandered
through the rooms from one to the
other, then upstairs to the “den,” where
in the dark she threw herself full length
on George’s hard leather lounge.</p>

<p>The walk of several miles must have
caused these excited feelings, this glow;
but she was conscious as well of a kind
of suffering agitation. She had walked
many miles in her life with no such exhilaration
as this.</p>

<p>To natures such as hers, by temperament
sluggish, an awakening is dangerous,
and means revolution. She never
had thought of love&mdash;that is, in connection
with herself or anyone she
knew. The idea that a married woman,
a nice one&mdash;of course there were bad
ones&mdash;could care for another man had
never occurred to her. The word “love”
she had never heard mentioned that she
could recall. Men like Warrener do not
talk of love; they avoid the word and
its chaotic consequences. She had
never said “I love you” in her life. Her
wooing had consisted of a timid kiss or
two, a decorous marriage into whose
ceremony the word “love” had slipped
unobserved, close to “honor” and
“obey.” “Love,” in that sentence, meant
that she submitted always with a sort of
shame and humiliation to be a wife;
“honor,” that neither of them would do
anything criminal, of course&mdash;how
should they? “Obey,” that she would
keep house for George. These, had
she been capable of pigeonholing her
ideas, were the grooves into which she
would have slipped her conceptions of
wedded life.</p>

<p>It is not strange that a woman with
a hostility to the laws of whose mysterious
passion she knows nothing should
refuse to linger in her thoughts on love
when it is so mentally surrounded.
Love stories she rarely read; she
thought them silly and little less than
sane. She couldn’t understand them&mdash;once
or twice they had given her unhappy,
lonely feelings, and she had not
sought their pages again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>On the sofa, in the dark, after the
first dazzling force of the feeling which
suffused her and which she did not understand,
she thought of her clothes!
She wished she had worn another dress,
her new <i>beige</i> and a pair of new boots.
As she had nothing but Mrs. Bellamy’s
afternoon dress with which to compare
her wardrobe, she could not construct
in her mind any new costume fitting to
such an occasion. Her coquetry had
not before been aroused. George did
not care what she wore. “You’re all
right in anything,” she could hear him
say.</p>

<p>No, she didn’t believe she was all
right. Mr. McAllister was, though.
How elegantly he was dressed! His
suit, his cravat, his hat and cane and
gloves! She was astonished at the
vividness with which his image came to
her. He seemed to stand there smiling
at her. It made her uneasy to think of
him so clearly. George dressed nicer
than most men, she had thought, but
beside Mr. McAllister&mdash;why, he looked&mdash;he
looked common! The word was
growing to be very useful to her.</p>

<p>After a little the effect of the open air
and the excitement overcame her reflections.
She grew drowsy and fell
into a light sleep. Her subjective self,
more keen and sensitive than her objective,
was released, and she dreamed,
for a rare thing, dream after dream.
Strange, unrestful visions. Mr. McAllister
was wound in and out of them,
tangled in their maze. She was trying
to run away from him. He was
beside her, and she was trying to push
him away. Out of the indistinct and
broken figures of sleep he became clearly
defined&mdash;he put his arm about her and
kissed her. As Gertrude felt the unwonted
and confusing touch on her lips&mdash;the
confusion of her senses&mdash;she
sprang up with a cry. There was some
one in the room.</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared, Gerty; it’s only
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she shuddered. “How you
frightened me, George! What did you
do it for?”</p>

<p>He turned up the light.</p>

<p>“Why, I couldn’t find you in our
room or the spare room, so I came in
here. Fell asleep waiting for me, did
you?”</p>

<p>He stood there, tired and grimy, his
hair mussed, his collar lacking its freshness.</p>

<p>“Well, you frightened me like anything,”
she said, petulantly. “What
did you do? Did you shake me?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t&mdash;I kissed you.”</p>

<p>She got up without reply and went
past him into the spare room.</p>

<p>Warrener said nothing until his preparations
for the night were made, then
calling out: “Aren’t you coming to bed,
Gertrude?” he went to the spare-room
door. It was locked.</p>

<p>Used to little petulant exhibitions of
temper whose pricks he had felt with
no serious wound, tired out and rendered
indifferent by the unremitting
brain and nerve tension of his life, Warrener
yielded passively, and, going into
the other room with a sigh of fatigue,
sought his deserted bed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Dancing Assemblies
of Philadelphia
and the St. Cecilia
Society of Charleston,
South Carolina, are
the two oldest subscription
balls in the
world. Their invitations
for this winter mark three centuries
in which the elect of the Quaker
and the Huguenot cities have been invited
to dance and to pay the fiddler.</p>

<p>The South Carolinians contend that
their famous dance is older than the
Philadelphia one. Both began in the
middle of the eighteenth century, and
the invitations went out through the
rest of the century, the whole of the
nineteenth, and through a half decade
of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The exact date of the first St. Cecilia
is not quite authenticated, because the
great fire which swept over Charleston
in 1865 destroyed St. Andrew’s Hall,
where the records of this dance were
kept. The flames also melted the magnificent
silver that had belonged to the
society for over a hundred years.</p>

<p>The date of the first Dancing Assembly
of Philadelphia is precisely fixed as
1749.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that two such exclusive
and elective balls, bound by
such rigid rules, and so opposed to new
members, should exist so long in the
whirling change of American life.</p>

<p>In Europe limited subscription balls
have not continued. Almach’s in London
was the most famous, but it was
swept out of existence by the rising tide
of wealth and new people.</p>

<p>The Patriarchs’ of New York, while
being governed by the same rules, and
of the same character as these two existing
balls, was not of great age, and
was abandoned years ago without a
murmur by a society that had outgrown
anything so provincial as the subscription
ball.</p>

<p>The St. Cecilia Society has continued
its dances since the beginning, but the
Philadelphia Assemblies were discontinued
through the Civil War.</p>

<p>Many have prophesied the dissolution
of both societies, but no one has
seriously considered it. That these two
balls continue to exist under the present
status of society, with its moneyed
kings buying admission everywhere, is
a curious and contradictory phase of
American life.</p>

<p>The fact that it is as difficult to enter
each of them now as it was in the latter
half of the eighteenth century is never
comprehended by the newly rich or by
the other millions of Americans who
have not come in contact with the aristocratic
exclusiveness of these two social
institutions.</p>

<p>The St. Cecilia is more exclusive
than the Assemblies for the reason that
Charleston has had her social lines arranged
since the first century of her
existence. Wealth, power, genius, ambition,
in a great horde are not knocking
at the doors of that ultra-refined
Carolina city for admission; but in a
great city like Philadelphia unknown
men become captains of industry overnight,
and their wives wail for admission
into the most fashionable function.</p>

<p>Tales that are told in broad social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
centers like New York, London and
Berlin, of the exclusiveness of these
two dances, are laughed at as the exaggerations
of those with a gift greater
for narrative than for fact.</p>

<p>In Charleston, when the St. Cecilia
was begun, many years before the
Revolution, the first subscription list
almost settled the question of admission
for the following centuries. On it
were names more powerful in the seats
of the nation’s mighty then than now.</p>

<p>Many were of Huguenot origin, others
of the first English blood. Among
the managers were signers of the Declaration
of Independence, and names
which still govern the social register
of to-day in Carolina, such as Ravenel,
Prioleau, Pringle, Drayton, Rhett,
Huger, Middleton, Fraser, Legare,
Porcher, Miles, Calhoun and Pinckney.</p>

<p>These are not even a quarter of the
names that before and after the Revolution
were an open sesame to American
and European society.</p>

<p>As near as possible, the sixteen managers
of the St. Cecilia have borne the
same name as the original managers.
When one died, another of the same
name was put in his place, if he could
be found in the United States. No innovation
has been permitted in the management
regarding admission, rules or
customs of this delightful ball since its
inception.</p>

<p>The person who is not on the list of
the St. Cecilia is not “in society” in
Charleston, and the rest of America accepts
this judgment of the arbiters as
regards Carolinians.</p>

<p>The aristocracy of the most exclusive
city in America is on that list. By
strangers, it is said to be the best managed
ball in America. Everything
moves like clockwork, because nothing
is theoretical, nothing is experimental.
It was arranged in the early days of
elegance, when manners were supreme.</p>

<p>No one tries to break the rules, which
are unique. Possibly the most peculiar
one is the refusal of the managers
to allow women to sit outside the
ballroom with men. Stairway flirtations,
cozy-corner <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</i>, are simply
not allowed. The rest of the civilized
world may consider these elegant,
the St. Cecilia does not. From this
verdict there is no appeal.</p>

<p>One woman, known throughout
American society as one of the potential
leaders of the smart Newport set,
thought herself above the traditions of
the Carolina ball. She was a guest at
this dance when in Charleston, and began
the evening by sitting out dances in
secluded corners outside the ballroom.
Comment ran rife. The sixteen managers
consulted together. The president,
a man of great manner and unfailing
elegance, took upon himself the duty to
correct the New York woman.</p>

<p>Finding her in a secluded corner, as
usual, he kindly informed her of the
comment she brought upon herself by
breaking the best-known rule of the
society. She was inclined to be ungracious
about it, and intimated that the
managers were old fogies, and that any
ball with such a tradition would be unbearable.</p>

<p>“It is done in London and New
York,” she defiantly said.</p>

<p>“But not in Charleston, madam,” answered
the president, as he offered her
his arm, which he never removed until
she took it. He then led her back to the
ballroom and offered her a chair.</p>

<p>The St. Cecilia gives three balls each
winter, and the men subscribers pay
the expenses. It would be impossible
to make them understand or approve
of the method of the Philadelphia Assemblies,
which charge women subscribers
the full price of the ticket. In
Charleston this would be considered not
only ungallant, but, frankly, an exhibition
of inferior breeding.</p>

<p>It is unlike a Southern ball in the
fact that the young women arrive, enter
the ballroom and return home with
chaperons. No other method is considered
among society people in Northern
cities, where girls are not allowed
to go alone with men to any place
of entertainment, but in Southern cities
this rule is transgressed with the full
approval of society.</p>

<p>The reason for this is easily explained.
Southern cities are small, and
the aristocratic community really goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
together to any social function, and
there is no reason for surrounding a
young girl with the conventions necessary
in a city of millions of people and
miles of crowded streets.</p>

<p>Before each dance the orchestra gives
the signal for every girl to return to
her chaperon. She cannot leave the
man with whom she is talking to join
the man to whom she is promised the
next dance. This partner must go to
her chaperon and await her return.</p>

<p>It is there he must claim the engagement.
This is not optional. It is
imperative. It would be considered
the greatest breach of good behavior
not to do it. In truth, no one thinks
of its being unique, or of not doing it
instinctively, because it is a tradition
that has governed the dance since before
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Surely there is not a man in the
world who does not see its advantages.
It prevents the possibility of being cornered
with a girl through two or three
dances, or being compelled to find her
a partner in order to free himself to
dance with some one else. In the slang
of the day, it saves the man from being
“stuck.”</p>

<p>The instant the orchestra begins this
preliminary canter to the dance, every
couple rises, and each girl expects her
escort to leave her the moment she
reaches her chaperon. For him to remain
would be an exhibition of social
awkwardness. A man can make as
many engagements on one girl’s card
as she will let him, but they must not
follow each other.</p>

<p>Dozens of men have sighed for this
rule at other balls, but so far the St.
Cecilia is the only one that had the
courage to start it and the conviction
to retain it.</p>

<p>Chaperons sit around the dancing
floor on a slight platform on which are
comfortable chairs. As all the girls return
before each dance&mdash;not after it,
mind you&mdash;the women rise to receive
them.</p>

<p>The young women make supper engagements
for the balls as the Northern
girls do.</p>

<p>The president always leads the march
to supper with the newest bride. Supper
is served promptly at midnight, and
the ball opens at the early hour of nine
o’clock. The men arrive earlier, for the
social conditions are such in the South
that there are more men than women,
and if they indulge in the foolish Eastern
habit of arriving just before
midnight, they haven’t a chance of finding
a single partner through the evening.</p>

<p>The society owns its present napery
and silver, which it bought with the first
ready money that came in after the desperate
financial straits of the terrible reconstruction.</p>

<p>It is as handsome as their splendid
plate of antebellum days, which was destroyed
by fire.</p>

<p>Both silver and napery bear the monogram
of the society, and the linen was
especially woven in Ireland. This gives
the table an aristocratic air impossible
when supper and silver are left to caterers.</p>

<p>The cook who prepares the supper is
a gingerbread-colored genius. His cooking
of wild duck still brings water to
the mouths of those who have been
asked to the feast.</p>

<p>The stranger might notice that the
managers and a few older men are absent
for some time after the guests have
returned from supper to the ballroom
for the two round dances. If they investigated
they would find that the
chosen few were regaling themselves
with supper made up of even more epicurean
dishes and rarer wines than the
many had enjoyed.</p>

<p>This is the time for the colored cook
to prove what he can do. Many a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonne bouche</i> is served that goes into
gastronomic history.</p>

<p>The most exciting moment of the
supper room is the scramble of the men
for a sugar figure which is placed on
the top of a huge fancy structure of
spun sugar. Each man tries to secure
this souvenir for his partner.</p>

<p>No matter how large the list of the
St. Cecilia has grown, the invitations
always have been delivered by hand.
This custom is a tradition that has
come down since the days before a mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
service was ever thought of. As all
other traditions were kept up, so was
this.</p>

<p>Edmund is the name of the darky who
possibly for half a century has delivered
these invitations from door to door.
He has been almost as important as the
St. Cecilia. He is a social register for
Charleston “quality.” He is as proud
of his descent, his position and his social
superiority as though his ancestors
had landed in the bay under the sturdy
Lion of St. George or the Flying Fleur-de-Lys
in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The society has never permitted the
german to be danced at this ball, although
it was introduced in other
Southern cities several years before the
Civil War. This is a prejudice well
known to the Charlestonian, and ignorance
of it once tripped up a social aspirant
who talked too much.</p>

<p>A certain man of wealth made many
an inducement for those in and out of
power to have him invited as a guest to
one of these balls while he was an usher
at a fashionable wedding in Charleston.
He did not succeed, but that did not
prevent his talking glibly in his own
city of the charm and defects of the St.
Cecilia as though he had been there. A
Charleston girl visiting in that city
stood his criticism of her beloved St.
Cecilia until he spoke of the <i>cotillon</i>.</p>

<p>“Strange,” she interrupted, “that you
should have danced a german there. No
set of managers has allowed this in one
hundred and sixty years.”</p>

<p>During the hardships of the Civil
War and privations of the reconstruction
the men abandoned dress suits for
these dances. They wore what they
could find. Purple and fine linen had
disappeared, and if the men who hadn’t
patched gray uniforms could get whole
suits of unbleached Macon Mills cloth,
with buttons of gourd seeds in some
cases, they were gay about it.</p>

<p>They danced as eagerly as they
fought, and tripped the measures of the
quadrille as cheerily as they charged
under the stimulus of the rebel yell.</p>

<p>They carried their swords at their
sides and their hearts on their sleeves,
and as willingly offered their sentiments
to the prettiest girl as they did their
bodies to Federal bullets.</p>

<p>A part of the rare charm of the St.
Cecilia dances lies in the presence of
the grandmothers and grandfathers of
the young set. Delightful old people
are present who do not attend other entertainments.
What would the St. Cecilians
do without Mr. Smith? “Turkey-tail
Smith,” as he has been called
for decades; a nickname to which he
does not object. Genial and kindly, he
is a part of the atmosphere, always fanning
himself and his partner with a turkey-tail
fan.</p>

<p>Many a lovely bride treasures his gift
of such a fan. Sad, sad the ignorance
of the East and West where the people
know not what love and laughter, what
limpid eyes and charming mouths, are
suggested by the turkey-tail fan of
Dixie.</p>

<p>It is natural that around the Philadelphia
Assemblies there should have
gathered an atmosphere of anecdote.
Its exclusiveness is so well known that
it is an honor for the man of millions to
belong to it, and his efforts, vain or successful,
to enter this social sanctuary,
have given the elect many a happy moment.</p>

<p>When the demure little group of
worldlings gathered together at Hamilton’s
Wharf to dance, they had no idea
of the sorrow, the heartaches, the Titanic
struggles, they were bequeathing
to posterity.</p>

<p>In 1749 a few married men and fewer
unmarried beaux subscribed forty
shillings apiece for a series of dances
to take place every Thursday night during
the winter. In those early days the
men paid all the expenses, and each subscriber
had the privilege of taking some
lady to each dance. Charming belles
of the day went down to the wharf on
the Delaware River on horseback, with
riding habits over evening gowns.</p>

<p>The dancing began promptly at six
o’clock and ended at eleven. The invitations
were printed on the backs of
playing cards, as these were the commonest
bits of pasteboard in the Colonies.
With the first Assembly distinct
social lines were drawn, but, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
nothing could equal or compare with
the rigid rules that have governed the
Assemblies for the last century, which,
if they were not taken so seriously,
might be absurd.</p>

<p>In those days no mechanic or tradesman
of any line of work was allowed to
be a subscriber; and no young man was
allowed to bring a young lady out of
the prescribed set.</p>

<p>After the Revolution an exceedingly
keen social blow was given these exclusive
little dances by President
George Washington.</p>

<p>The Virginian, whose blood was of
the finest in the land, was invited to
dance at this Assembly on the same
night that he was also invited to a
dance given by the tradespeople. He
chose the latter, and led the minuet with
one of its prettiest young women.</p>

<p>A premium was put upon promptness
in these old days by the managers,
who gave to the women arriving first
the distinction of dancing in the opening
set. Those who came afterward
were put in the second set, and so on.</p>

<p>They had another plan of letting
the women draw numbers and dance
in the sets which corresponded to the
number they held. This was an unhappy
way to manage a ball. Historians
of the city life tell us that both of
these customs were broken up through
the rebellion of lovely young Polly
Riche, who, with the man of her choice,
insisted on dancing in any set she
pleased.</p>

<p>The managers protested, but the
young men sided with her, and the result
was that the Assembly took on
more freedom and, therefore, more
pleasure.</p>

<p>These little dances had their serious
troubles even then. The Quakers had
nothing to do with them, of course, but
did not make any serious comment upon
them. Presbyterians loudly disapproved,
but the Episcopalians, even the
clergy, lent not only tolerance, but cordial
indorsement.</p>

<p>The tiny list of subscribers has
reached nearly a thousand in the twentieth
century. Instead of the little
room lit by wax candles on the Delaware
River, and possibly filled with
the fruity and salty odors from merchants’
ships, the dancers now gather
in the gorgeous salons of the great new
Bellevue Stratford Hotel. Instead of
a few fiddlers, there is one of the greatest
dancing orchestras in America. Instead
of beginning at six o’clock and
ending at midnight, the ball begins at
twelve o’clock and ends at dawn.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to those who
care for the cakes and ale to read the
comparison between the “refreshments”
served then and now.</p>

<p>In 1749 and throughout the next
decade the supper consisted of nine
shillings’ worth of milk biscuit and five
gallons of rum, added to two hundred
limes for a punch. And, mind you,
this punch was served to only a few
people.</p>

<p>The supper served this last winter
was as follows:</p>

<p class="p1 center">
<span class="larger">CHAUD</span><br />
Bonne Bouche Assembly<br />
Gumbo Passe<br />
Terrapin<br />
Poulet de Grain Supérieur<br />
Pommes de Terre Nouvelles Rissoles<br />
Jambon de Virginie<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="larger">FROID</span><br />
Chaufroix de Grouse<br />
Cœur de Laitue<br />
Filet de Bœuf<br />
Salade de Chapon<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Pudding Montrose<br />
Croquants <span class="in8">Marrons Glacé</span><br />
Bonbons<br />
Café
</p>

<p class="p1">Instead of forty shillings for eighteen
dances, each subscriber now pays ten
dollars for two. These two balls are
given after New Year’s and before
Lent, and because of their exclusiveness,
remain the most unique function
in Philadelphia life.</p>

<p>Old families who take admission into
the Assemblies as a matter of course
will tell you how stupid they are, how
tiresome, how foolish the rules of admission
are, and that really everybody
can get in now; but you would almost
have to take their own invitations away
over their dead bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>As in Charleston, one sees at these
balls men and women who rarely put
on evening clothes except for these affairs.
It is a witticism attributed to
the dashing captain of the First City
Troop of Philadelphia that when asked
why he didn’t like the Assemblies, he
responded: “I never could stand the
smell of camphor and tar balls.”</p>

<p>If the rules were always consistently
kept, there would not be such a
happy fund of anecdote around the Assemblies.
The five managers, who are
called “czars” by the irreverent, do their
best through the decades to use judgment
and consistency for the admission
of new members, but it is also
true that some “queer” people have
been admitted and that some of the
most delightful, with pedigrees as old
as the hills, have been kept out.</p>

<p>New rules have been constantly made
in the attempt to meet new emergencies.
Everything tends to the same
aim, which is to keep out all new members
except the children of parents who
are already subscribers. And it is also
true that peculiar rules, which in many
cases are only known to the “czars”
themselves, are made as an excuse to
drop those who for certain reasons may
not be considered desirable.</p>

<p>The inner Philadelphian will tell you
that a number of “peculiar” people got
in about fifteen years ago, when there
was a year of laxity regarding admission.
It was just after this epoch that
some of the most influential financial
powers in social life resigned from the
management because they frankly said
they could not withstand the pressure
brought upon them by men closely associated
with them in business who
wanted invitations for their wives.</p>

<p>Most of these men who clamored for
membership threatened to “squeeze”
the managers of the Assemblies unless
they could “pull the ropes” for these
admission cards.</p>

<p>Even now there are many embarrassing
situations between men of millions
and poor men of social power. It is
known that ambitious millionaires have
gotten young men clerkships in their
offices and then held over their heads
dismissal or raise of salary according
to their failure or success in obtaining
for their wives and daughters the coveted
prize.</p>

<p>Scandal after scandal has arisen in
this way, and dozens of men have felt
too nervous over such gossip to be seen
much with their superiors in wealth
who are well-known social climbers.</p>

<p>The newcomers are usually the most
blatant about the rules and the traditions
of the Assemblies. A certain
couple in Philadelphia, who have lived
much in the great centers of Europe and
been presented at foreign courts, have
been embittered for two decades because
of the refusal of a succession of
“czars” to allow them the privilege of
the Assemblies.</p>

<p>Each new batch of managers were
deftly and luxuriously entertained by
the millionaire couple. Their palates
were tickled, their financial interests
promoted by subtle methods. But all
was of no avail until a near relative
of the couple, a man of national power,
arrived home, bearing in his official
cornucopia gifts for younger sons. In
return, his relatives were finally invited
to become members of the Assemblies.</p>

<p>At the first ball the lady went to the
man in charge of the supper room, who
was entirely new to the traditions of
this dance, and between them they reserved
a table.</p>

<p>In true hotel fashion he tipped the
chairs over on a round table in the supper
room. When two of the managers
went to look over the arrangements an
hour before supper, they found the
chairs in this position. There was an
indignant colloquy, and the head man
was ordered never to do it again. But
as his bribe was probably worth while,
he fixed it so that when the grand
march was over and the guests had arrived
in the supper room, the newcomers
were at once placed at the table
for which they paid, although dozens
of people who had belonged to the Assemblies
as a matter of course had to
await their chances.</p>

<p>Another story is told of this same
couple. On their entrance to the ballroom,
at their first appearance, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
saw another couple, also from up the
State, who were their rivals for exclusive
Philadelphia favor, and also possessed
of millions.</p>

<p>Putting up her lorgnon, the lady remarked
in a voice that could well be
heard by the other couple: “How in
the world did those people get here?”</p>

<p>The managers were fearful of dozens
of intruders finding their way into
the social sanctuary this winter, when
the balls were transferred to the magnificent
Bellevue Stratford, instead of
being held in the old Academy of Music.
A hotel has a dozen entrances, and
they feared the “unwashed” might secure
an entrance into the ballroom, or,
what was worse, go into one of the
boxes that surrounded the dancing
floor and look on. This being suggested,
there was tremendous commotion
and confusion among the elect.
Orders were given right and left, and
the tortures of the Inquisition promised
the doorkeeper if such a thing happened.</p>

<p>A certain well-known couple who are
anxious not to mix with those who do
not belong to the Assembly set were
among the most ardent in their endeavors
to impress upon all men that
no strangers should be allowed through
any entrance to boxes. The lady, wishing
to see the scene from an elevated
position, went up to one of the boxes
during the ball and sat slightly back to
get a commanding view, so she was not
recognized at the distance. Suddenly
she was discovered by the managers.
Her husband was among the chief of
those who insisted that peremptory action
must be taken. The doorman was
sent to eject her from the box or ask
for her passport. He went with great
hesitation, for the duty was not a
pleasant one. To give him courage the
husband of the lady followed, and he
entered the box just as the colored man
was ejecting his wife!</p>

<p>The five managers who are at the
head of these balls do not assume the
personal responsibility for the guests’
pleasure as do the sixteen managers of
the St. Cecilia.</p>

<p>There is no one person of any especial
force or command who is looked up
to for detail.</p>

<p>When the late Ward McAllister, of
New York, creator of the “Four Hundred,”
which, among other trivialities,
gave him fame, was a guest at one of
the Assemblies, he was as pompous as
usual and quite interested in the social
mechanism of this famous ball, the
like of which he had tried to create in
the Patriarchs’, but couldn’t succeed.</p>

<p>He was walking with one of the well-known
wits of Philadelphia, who was a
power in Assembly affairs.</p>

<p>“I would like to meet the man at the
head of everything,” said Mr. McAllister;
“the one, you know, who has
charge of the details. The Patriarchs
have such a man.” He referred to himself,
of course. “And I suppose there
must be some one here who really takes
charge, don’t you know. Have I met
him? You have such a one, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered his companion;
“I think I know whom you mean. We
have such a man. It saves us all the
trouble of detail. He is Holland, the
colored caterer. He is out in the supper
room now.”</p>

<p>Mr. McAllister was more fortunate
in getting into the Assemblies than some
other people who come from New
York’s most distinguished families. An
incident illustrates the extreme indifference
to any rules outside of their own
that the managers of the Assemblies
have.</p>

<p>A beautiful Philadelphia girl was
about to be married to the son of one
of New York’s social leaders. The
mother of the bride-elect was one of
the most exclusive and aristocratic social
figures in Philadelphia. Three days
before the ball was given she was in
New York at some of the pre-nuptial
festivities, and when her prospective
son-in-law’s family became interested in
her stories of the Assemblies and expressed
a desire to see such a ball, she
cordially invited them over.</p>

<p>Eight of them came, with maids,
valets and trunks of finery. The Philadelphia
hostess wrote a note to one of
the managers, asking for invitations, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
these courtesies are extended to a few
strangers each year who are the guests
of a subscriber. The lady’s request
was politely but firmly declined. She
and her husband were amazed, indignant
and puzzled. In all her experience
as an exclusive society leader, she had
never been “turned down” before. For
generations, on both her own and her
husband’s side, members of their families
had served as managers of the Assemblies.
Her husband went at once
to his intimate friends on the committee
and explained the situation. It was
not necessary to explain who the New
Yorkers were, for they also were among
the exclusive families in America.</p>

<p>Nothing had any effect. Persuasion
won over four of the managers by
nightfall, but one remained obdurate,
and one black ball is sufficient to veto
anything.</p>

<p>The eight New Yorkers repacked
their finery and returned home, absolutely
turned down like the merest social
adventurers by men who wouldn’t
break a rule in order to be courteous.</p>

<p>And the sole reason of it all was this:
The list of guests had closed on a fixed
date, and no emergency could reopen
it. The request was presented too late.</p>

<p>It is not against the rules to invite
strangers, but they can’t be invited offhand.
It would be like bestowing the
Order of the Knight of the Garter casually.
Each name presented by a subscriber
must be investigated by the five
managers, and then voted upon. The
subscriber must guarantee to the committee
that the stranger is not living in
Philadelphia, or, if so, that the period of
residence has not extended over two
years. Philadelphians who are born and
have lived here for generations, who go
intimately with the smartest set, are declined
admission while they are here,
because their ancestors were not subscribers,
but all they have to do is to
move away for a year to any other city,
and their friends here can get them invitations
at once as “strangers.”</p>

<p>A woman who is not a subscriber
may become one if she marries a subscriber.
If she is a subscriber when
unmarried and weds a man who is not a
subscriber, she must forfeit the privilege
of going, and not one of her children
can be admitted, except a daughter
who remarries into the subscribing
set.</p>

<p>An outsider who can prove direct descent
from an original subscriber and
then has a “pull” with the managers
can be admitted for membership. In
the old days a man who married a
woman subscriber could share her honors
and go with her. The custom prevailed
until one of the most popular
girls in the Assembly married a man
who, while personally liked, belonged
to an ordinary family, whose financial
ways had not been approved by Philadelphians
for decades. The bridegroom
came to the ball with his bride, because
a rule was a rule; so the managers met
and abolished the rule, but not the man.
The groom, however, was not one of
the strugglers who want to kick down
other climbers. He is a man of humor
as well as good sense, and he convulsed
those who laugh at the pretensions
of the Assemblies by his response
to a discussion regarding the admission
of another man who was not of the
elect.</p>

<p>“Why can’t <i>he</i> get in?” said the
groom. “I’m in.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the managers, this
new rule, which seemed so satisfactory,
gave them a bad quarter of an hour for
the next ball. The daughter of the
chief and most distinguished manager
married a man who was not a subscriber.
The couple were at once refused
an invitation for the next Assembly.
This was quite too much for
the father, who was willing to turn
down some one else, but one of his own
family&mdash;why&mdash;such a thing was never
heard of. And so, in confusion and
dismay, the managers had to secretly
break their new rule, and invite this
bride and groom, who have been going
ever since.</p>

<p>When a male scion of one of the
really great families married the daughter
of an all-too-well-known sporting
man, he and his wife were refused a
subscription to the following balls.</p>

<p>“If he can’t go, neither can we,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
wrote one hundred members of his
family. This was too much for the
managers again, and they meekly consented
to let him enter.</p>

<p>When a girl who has not been able
to go, no matter how charming and
attractive she is, marries a subscriber,
the one comment that sweeps over the
church is: “Well, she can go to the
Assemblies now.”</p>

<p>One mother, who all of her life had
been ruled by this social law, wept when
her daughter told her that she was going
to marry a man out of the list. The
girl was a healthy, straightforward,
American type, who did everything athletic
and copied the field and turf when
she talked. The man she was to marry
had every desirable quality, except his
name on the Golden Book.</p>

<p>“You will break my heart by such a
marriage,” wailed the mother; “the
first of all our family to be denied the
Assemblies. You must give this man
up.”</p>

<p>“Give up a bully man for a stupid
ball? Well, I guess not,” was the final
answer of the frank daughter. And
she married the man.</p>

<p>One of the momentous questions that
cost the managers sleepless nights was
a question of ancestors, caused by two
débutantes. They were children of a
couple who had married the second
time. One, the wife’s daughter, was by
a former husband, who didn’t belong to
the Assemblies. The other was a daughter
of the husband by a first wife, both
of whom belonged to the Assemblies.
The girls had been brought up together
from childhood, and when they came
out in society, the father asked for their
invitations together. This precipitated
one of the most momentous emergencies
that the managers ever had to meet.
This exact question had never come before
the Assembly. All kinds of advice,
social and legal, were asked, and the
question convulsed society. Everyone
debated it, and everyone took sides.
After many meetings by the managers,
the decision was reached that the stepdaughter
of the father couldn’t be invited,
but that the stepdaughter of the
mother could.</p>

<p>And such a hold have the rules of the
Assembly on Philadelphians, that nothing
about this was considered unusual.
Had it been a question of admittance
by descent into the House of Peers, it
couldn’t have been more important.</p>

<p>But if it were not for the peculiarity
of these rules and customs which govern
the two oldest balls in the world, it
is doubtful if they would have become
famous, or if they would have preserved,
through the centuries, their
unique charm, their peculiar social
aroma.</p>

<p>We are a restless, easily wearied,
ever-changing people. It is delightful
to know that in the hurly-burly these
two social affairs live out the traditions
of our ancestors.</p>

<p>May they always copy their manners!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE house stood in the
corner of a quiet
square, a little south
and west of the Green
Park, and the room in
which most of his
evenings were spent
was on the balcony
floor. The balconies had blossomed.
They burst in a wreath of color round
the grim quadrangle in festal imitation
of the spring, when the newer beauties
and the May buds were coming out; but
before Jim South’s windows were only
a few green shrubs, which died hard
through the summer. He always admired
his neighbors’ decorations, without
noticing the deficiencies of his own;
yet that garland round the old dark
fronts often seemed to him like roses
on a faded face; there lurked a sort of
shame behind the sweetness; it was almost
a trifling with age.</p>

<p>The square was a kind of back eddy
to the Palace Road, and held a strained
hum from the traffic round it. The silence,
which raised the rents, had attracted
South; he used more of it, he
said, than most of those who paid them,
farming it himself.</p>

<p>He meant that he was less often an
absentee than those about him, but his
phrase suggested an alternative of occupation
which did not exist; for never
was a man with less of harness on his
back. He lived solely for his own
amusement; cropping life’s greenness
in a slow, easy, ruminant fashion, and
on a modest income. A cousin was his
nearest relative.</p>

<p>He had a fire this evening, though
half May was past, and his book had
dropped from his hand, when the man
who was owner, factotum and, with his
wife, comptroller to that small household
of bachelors, announced:</p>

<p>“Miss Rosamond Merlin!”</p>

<p>It was a girl who entered; a girl
with a woman’s buoyant movement and
pose; a woman with a girl’s footfall.
She wore a cloak which was somewhat
oppressively magnificent, and held out
a hand to South, laughing, as he rose.</p>

<p>“Surprised?”</p>

<p>“Delighted!” he said.</p>

<p>She sighed as she dropped into his
seat.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you are.”</p>

<p>He pushed a chair to the further side
of the fireplace, and watched, while she
drew off slowly her long gloves, with
the flicker of curiosity which was always
lambent on his face. It was like
a color there.</p>

<p>The girl bent down, and spread out
her arms to the glow. She let them fall
on the front of her skirt, pressing it
back from the little pink and gold slippers
on the grate stone.</p>

<p>“What a man you are for fires!” she
said.</p>

<p>“I like warmth.”</p>

<p>“In coals,” was her retort.</p>

<p>She looked up at him sideways, smiling.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask to see my
frock?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to,” he said.</p>

<p>Her eyes brimmed with unbelief.</p>

<p>“You know you don’t care tuppence,”
she said; but she threw the cloak at last
from her shoulders, and leaned back in
the chair, drooping an admiring eye.
She was on her way to the great costume
ball of the season, and forced from
South a hazard at her masquerade.</p>

<p>“Apple blossom?” he ventured, and
was complimented.</p>

<p>“Ah, you should see it standing up;
but you’re not worth that. Look there!”</p>

<p>She spread out the phantom of a fan,
shaped and painted as a tuft of its
tinted bloom.</p>

<p>“Veynes gave it me,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, did he?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, he did. Are you sorry for
Veynes?”</p>

<p>“I!&mdash;why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do be sensible!&mdash;you’re not that
much of a fool;&mdash;because I’ve got him,
or he’s got me, whichever you like.
Don’t you think it’s bad for him?”</p>

<p>“It might be worse,” South said.</p>

<p>“Thank you. It might, you know;
’specially with Veynes. Oh, I say, do
you mind my coming here?”</p>

<p>“I can mind nothing else for days,”
he laughed. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I thought your man looked a sort
of piled-up disapproval when he let me
in.”</p>

<p>“For us all?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and for himself.”</p>

<p>“For himself! Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s probably seen my face too
often in shop windows to care to see it
here. You’re all deadly respectable,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“The whole square is; we’ve taken
life policies in propriety. Money, art
and titles, and all of it married.”</p>

<p>She gave a little wince at that, but
asked if he would offer her some coffee.
South was famous in a small way for
making it, and his friends, when out of
humor with the world, would come and
watch the brown liquid bubble through
the valves of some strange machine of
copper and nacreous glass he had
picked up in the East, and regain their
“values” over a cup.</p>

<p>He pushed a hanging kettle across
the flame, and knelt down by his visitor
to stir the fire.</p>

<p>“Turkish?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“That’s the gritty stuff, isn’t it? No,
the other; and black. Why is your hair
so long?”</p>

<p>“Is it? I’ve forgotten it. What is
this on your shoe?”</p>

<p>“The gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Letters.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“R. E. V.”</p>

<p>“A monogram?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Whose?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s.”</p>

<p>She swept her train across her little
feet and laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Are you learning to be inquisitive?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>South did not say. He lifted the kettle
from its crutch, and set the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafetière</i>
in action.</p>

<p>Rosamond screwed her chair round
to the table, and spread her arms upon
it, resting her cheek on one of them to
watch his proceedings.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to know?” she
asked, presently.</p>

<p>The bubbles in the dim glass tubes
ran to and fro half a minute before he
replied.</p>

<p>“To know what?”</p>

<p>“About my slippers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, curiosity,” he shrugged.</p>

<p>She tilted her face further over on
her white forearm, and her eyes came
round to his.</p>

<p>“I thought you hadn’t any?” she said.</p>

<p>His “Only about trifles” was meant
unkindly; but she refused to take offense.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s a compliment to my
number threes,” she smiled; “so I’d explain
the letters on them if I could;
but they came from Veynes with the
fan, so I can only guess&mdash;perhaps they
stand for the motto of his house.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” he assented, grimly.
“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Regina ex vulgo</i>, or something of the
sort. Are you going to adopt it?”</p>

<p>“To adopt what?”</p>

<p>“The motto of his house.”</p>

<p>She rose without replying, and
walked to an antique mirror which covered
a corner of the room. She faced
it with a sigh of satisfaction, and then
turned slowly round upon her toes till
her shoulders were reflected. Her head
was flung back out of the lamp light
which yellowed her breast, and the gold
of her coiled hair floated over her in
the darkness like a misty moon.</p>

<p>She stood, poised doubtfully for some
time, pinching her little waist downward
with both hands.</p>

<p>“Do you think it shows too much?”
she inquired, presently, without moving.</p>

<p>South looked up from the table.</p>

<p>“For what?” he said.</p>

<p>“For what do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>“For my taste, or for yours, or for
Veynes’, or for modesty&mdash;or what?”</p>

<p>“For yours, if you like.”</p>

<p>“For mine, yes! I don’t mean that I
see too much of you, but it’s so tremendously
announced; it’s squeezed into
one’s eye.”</p>

<p>“And for modesty?”</p>

<p>“Oh, modesty doesn’t depend on
clothes, any more than purity did on fig
leaves. Eve only began to sew when
she had lost hers. Come and drink
your coffee.”</p>

<p>She came, after some further observation,
and sipped in silence from the
cup he handed her. He had a dozen
questions on his tongue, but could not
or would not put them; the girl seemed
too independent. He mentioned finally
the current report that they were to
see her in the new piece at the Variety.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not,” she said. “It’s
a dancing part, and I’m going to <i>act</i>
when I go back to the boards.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I can.”</p>

<p>“That would seem to be as good a
reason the other way.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> know,” she scoffed.</p>

<p>“I do; I saw you three times.”</p>

<p>“Three!&mdash;some men saw me thirty.”</p>

<p>“I dare say. I couldn’t afford it.”</p>

<p>“The price of a seat?”</p>

<p>“No, the solace of one; the one you’re
in; it’s almost a housewife in its economies.”</p>

<p>“Economies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, economies of content. It guarantees
<i>that</i> while I stay in its arms. I
think I buy it cheap.”</p>

<p>“Content! I wouldn’t take it as a
gift; it’s a despair with a trousseau, a
sort of bridal and sanctified kind of
funk. Oh, content’s a miserable thing.”</p>

<p>South laughed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “it’s not often offered
with a ring. Will you take another
cup?”</p>

<p>She pushed hers toward him and
asked if he had any brandy in the
house.</p>

<p>South nodded at a liquor stand, but
suggested <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">crème de menthe</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s not for me,” she explained, “but
for my driver&mdash;he’s got an awful cough;
I’ve been listening to it up here all the
time. Could you send him a glass?”</p>

<p>South laid his hand on the bell.</p>

<p>“What driver?” he said.</p>

<p>“The man on my hansom; he’s been
waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“Why do you keep him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. Veynes does.”</p>

<p>“Is Veynes in the cab?”</p>

<p>“No, no, silly!&mdash;it’s Veynes’ hansom;
he sent it round for me. The driver of
Veynes’ hansom has a cough, you have
some brandy, and I want you to send
it down by your man to the driver, that
his cough may be stayed. Now do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” he said; but he did
as she desired.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is a fresh indiscretion,”
she remarked, as the man retired.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” he replied, “but the
freshness need not count for much
among so many. Is Veynes coming
here for you?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, no!” she laughed. “He
wouldn’t quite understand it; it doesn’t
occur to him that a girl who kicks her
skirts about at so much a week can ever
want anything of a man but flattery and
new frocks. A good deal of dullness
goes with a title, you know.”</p>

<p>“If by dullness you mean bewilderment,
I might be a duke. Will you explain?”</p>

<p>“Why I’m here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I understand that; you’ve
tried to make me envy Tantalus before;
but why you’ve forgotten your prudence
and your promises&mdash;I used to believe
in both&mdash;and what has become of your
chaperon; and how deep Lord Veynes
is in it.”</p>

<p>She left all but the last question unanswered,
and said, looking from him
toward the fire:</p>

<p>“He wants me to marry him.”</p>

<p>She missed the quick spring of his
eyes to her face, but she met them the
next moment.</p>

<p>“Am I to congratulate you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“You might have said <i>him</i>,” she remarked;
“however, it’s good of you not
to jump&mdash;but you always could sit still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
I know you’re saying something nasty
inside of you; mayn’t I hear it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am,” he replied. “I
was wondering precisely where I came
in?”</p>

<p>“You come in here,” she laughed,
with halting mirth; “you’re the oracle;
you roll out the future in a hollow
voice; you say what you think.”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I forgot,” she ran on, “you never
do; you say what you think some one
else will think of what you wouldn’t
say if you thought it; isn’t that it? You
explained it to me once, but it wasn’t
clear. Well, say that! Say something!
You’ve known Veynes longer than I
have; say he’s not good enough for
me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s understood,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“By Veynes?”</p>

<p>“By Veynes just at present, probably.
I meant by you and me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” she flouted. “You
mightn’t think yourself good enough.”</p>

<p>It was a curious challenge for a
man’s matrimonial amen. The woman
thirsting for love and eager to drink
it; the man thirsty and afraid. She did
not see the sudden change in his eyes,
as though a flame went through them.
She was looking the other way. But
she heard the parry of his low “I should
not” to her thrust. It pierced like the
white pinch of frost, it ran cold even
into her voice.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re too modest,” she rallied,
so briskly that he did not notice the
shiver in her throat. “Besides, you’re
rather cowed by my frock; but how
about the family?”</p>

<p>“Veynes’?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There’s only Lord Egham.”</p>

<p>“Only Lord Egham! No sisters,
mothers, aunts&mdash;nothing? Oh, come,
that’s better. And what is he like?”</p>

<p>“He’s a dear old gentleman who
dotes on his son.”</p>

<p>“Then he’d take me badly?”</p>

<p>“I fancy so.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a big question. Perhaps
his education was defective.”</p>

<p>“I dare say. He’s an earl, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Earl of Egham, sits as Viscount
Alderly.”</p>

<p>“I see; and some day I might be a
countess?”</p>

<p>“You might.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bribe; I like the word awfully;
it sounds <i>good</i>; it’s like a stare
to say it&mdash;the countess!&mdash;but I fancy it
would be rather dreadful being one&mdash;that
is, if you weren’t born to it&mdash;in the
cast all along, don’t you know. Of
course, then you could do what you
liked; but if you’d only been made one,
and made from a dancing girl, you’d
<i>have</i> to be proper, just to show how
easy it came! And I think it would
be dull,” she drawled. “What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he affirmed.</p>

<p>“Not even to save poor Veynes from
his fate? You could save him.”</p>

<p>He looked slowly across at her face,
which lay back idly under the yellow
light, and she held her eyes squarely
to his, as a maid holds a mirror to her
mistress. He might search them for
reflections, but he would see nothing
more. In point of fact, he looked for
some time without troubling their surface.</p>

<p>“Marry him,” he said.</p>

<p>“And the earl?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must treat him kindly, and
show him what an excellent countess
you can make.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?”</p>

<p>“I fancy not. You’re too human, you
see; this warm, kind world is too near
your heart. The great lady has nothing
there but her corset; and the world&mdash;her
little cold world&mdash;at her fingers’
ends, in a descending scale of chilliness.
Besides, you’re too pretty.”</p>

<p>“To be a countess?”</p>

<p>“No, to be made one. You can’t
melt beauty for new molds without
breaking the old, you know; something
goes.”</p>

<p>“And yet you say&mdash;marry him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t say it,” he replied.</p>

<p>She had turned her head away, and
was stretching over her shoulders for
her wrap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going,” she said.</p>

<p>He rose to put it round her, and
caught the reflection in the glass of her
averted eyes. They were shining with
tears.</p>

<p>She held out her hand, shook his
shortly, and went toward the door.</p>

<p>“You needn’t come down,” she said,
as he followed her.</p>

<p>“No, but I will.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t; I don’t want you.”</p>

<p>There was something more imperative
in her decree than its tone&mdash;a sob;
that stopped him at the open door.</p>

<p>The sound of her feet ceased from
the stair, the front door slammed, and
he walked across to the window, waiting
there till the noisy motion of her
hansom ebbed into the dull roar of the
streets.</p>

<p>He stayed even longer, and the May
sky had lost its last memory of the day
ere he sat down again before his dying
fire.</p>

<p>The girl’s gay audacity seemed to
linger like an odor in the room; made
pungent, as it were, by that sob. He
had not noticed it before. Conscious
audacity it was not; for she wore her
beauty as a sort of decoration, the star
of some regal order, which sanctioned
the fine animal magnificence with which
she had set the obligations of nobility
behind those of good looks, and doubted
if the charmed circle of coronets might
not prove too dull for her endurance;
putting, without a tinge of affectation,
nature’s creations before those of dead
kings.</p>

<p>But it was not of her vivid exuberance
that South was thinking; he had
inhaled that before, and the intoxication
of it was dissolved. But those sly
touches of humility, too faint to be felt
through the written record of her
words, dropped lids, and looks, and
pauses, so unlike her, pressed still as a
hand upon his lifted arm. Yet he told
himself he had understood them, without
the compulsion of her tears.</p>

<p>At least he understood this: that she
had thrown the weight of her beauty
without avail against the ease and freedom
of his unwedded days. Yet it left
him with a pricking sense&mdash;not of repentance&mdash;but
that repentance might
confront, might even confound, him.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Some five months earlier in the year
Lord Veynes had returned from a voyage
round the world.</p>

<p>It was to have completed his education,
which included, besides some
Greek grammar, the use of a cue, a little
Cavendish and the racing calendar.
He was five-and-twenty, a gentleman;
dressed well, looked well and lived well;
on the whole, a nice fellow, deeply attached
to his father and devotedly to
himself.</p>

<p>The former was becoming an old
man, having married late in life; was
short, had a stoop, a halo of whitened
hair, and a face that was a mask of merriment.
His kindliness and humor were
bywords, and his stories always made a
widening silence in a room, to which
fresh listeners drifted. He would laugh
at them himself, yet his laughter seemed
their best part, their sincerest compliment;
it was like humor itself holding
its sides.</p>

<p>He had filled every county dignity in
turn, but they made no mark on him
nor he on them; he bore them dutifully,
but he was glad to be rid of them;
they added something to his tales, to the
fullness of his humor, to the softness of
his heart; perhaps to public knowledge
of his incompetence. Yet he was liked
none the less for his failures; his blunt
honesty thrust out of them obtrusively,
as an elbow through a ragged sleeve.</p>

<p>Veynes was the one relic of his married
life, having cost his mother her
life; and he was adored as things may
be that are made so ruinously unique.
He was a good boy, and stood a great
deal of spoiling; but he had argued,
naturally, his own adorableness from so
much adoration, and would have honored
his father’s encomiums to any
amount.</p>

<p>His home-coming had all the decoration
of triumphal entries&mdash;flags, festival
arches and singing children; afterward
a tenant dinner, tenant humor and
considerable drowsiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>When it was all over, and the two
men sat together by the log fire in the
hall, which burned red splashes on the
armored walls, the earl opened the subject
nearest his heart&mdash;an heir.</p>

<p>“I want to see him here before I’m
gone,” he concluded, with a kind of
ruefulness which was a part of his pathos
and of his humor; “and, by George,
my boy, if you don’t marry soon, I will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll marry, I’ll marry,” laughed
the other, “but you must find me the
girl.”</p>

<p>Love, however, did that, though the
earl was assiduous, surrounding the
young man for the betterment of his
choice with half the eligible petticoats
in the county; a mistake, seeing that
iteration and propinquity in affairs of
the heart are of more assistance than
variety.</p>

<p>Yet it was, in the end, variety which
succeeded, in the person of Miss Rosamond
Merlin.</p>

<p>She had come to lend terpsichorean
relief to an amateur performance of burlesque
in the neighborhood, and her appearance
transformed Veynes, in a single
night, from a conscientious brigand
to a distracted and distracting piece of
stage furniture; though it is but fair
to add he was not the only one affected;
for none of his brother bandits were,
when slain&mdash;while Miss Rosamond was
upon the stage&mdash;as stiff as their previous
rigidity had led one to expect.</p>

<p>Miss Merlin attended but three rehearsals;
yet ere the night of the performance,
Veynes had decided, as he put
it, that they were made for one another&mdash;a
phrase which has not, in a man’s
mouth, all the reciprocity that it conveys.
He offered the idea to Miss Rosamond
while applying some powder to
her cheek.</p>

<p>She laughed, knocked the puff out of
his hand, and ran on to the stage; but
she found him awaiting her exit, deaf
to cues and stage directions, in a kind
of tragic calm.</p>

<p>“I mean it,” he protested.</p>

<p>She widened her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, mean it a little later,” she said.</p>

<p>He took the hint and waited till, having
found her some food, they were
sitting in the deserted supper room, in
an atmosphere of exhausted hilarity,
among the ruins of the waiters.</p>

<p>“Have you thought it over?” he
asked, impressively.</p>

<p>“I, no!&mdash;do I ever think anything
over but a new step? Besides, such a
simple little thing!”</p>

<p>“Simple!” he stammered.</p>

<p>“To say no to. Do you think I’d have
the cheek to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you?” dropped the young
man, feebly.</p>

<p>He was innocent of having conceived,
still less suggested, so tremendous a
contingency; indeed, her contemplation
of it, even in dismissal, appeared unseemly.
For he had been strictly
brought up, and had added, “Thou shalt
not wed the name of Veynes in vain,”
to a decalogue somewhat abridged, and,
as his, father put it, “edited by Debrett.”</p>

<p>But neither his decalogue nor his delicacy
prevented him from sketching airily
the insignificance of wedding symbols
in an aristocratic connection when
the heart was involved.</p>

<p>“People talk such nonsense, you
know,” he said.</p>

<p>She smiled with engaging innocence,
and he edged a little nearer to his meaning,
hoping she would meet him halfway.</p>

<p>It was like laying a wash of color beside
another which might be wet; he
was horribly afraid of a smear; he
thought she might have assured him,
figuratively, that she would not run.
But she only helped herself to another
<i>meringue</i>.</p>

<p>He made pauses and filled the silence
with his eyes; but she met them with a
pensive examination through the prongs
of her fork; and the smiles he fancied
ambiguous seemed, reflected on her
mouth, to be merely inane; so he was
driven back upon words and impersonal
allusiveness. He groaned, in explanation,
over the austerity which would tie
all love knots to a wedding ring; suggesting
that some people were able to
conceive of them apart.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>She gleamed with malicious coquetry.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t and wouldn’t,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
decisively. “Love and marry and trust
to luck, that’s my sentiment; but don’t
marry if you can’t love; and don’t love
if you can’t marry; and don’t do either&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If you think you’re going to do
both.”</p>

<p>“Poof!” he pouted.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it’s not; it’s the very sober
fact. Love’s a fever, you know, and no
better than most of them&mdash;contagious
and malagious and infectious and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>“But that’s the truth; it’s carried in
frocks, pretty ones; and it’s caught by
touching, and it’s regular poison to
breathe! Then it must be in the air,
because people take it in clumps, perfect
epidemics; and the best way to catch it
is to let yourself get low and dumpy.
When you’ve got it, the only thing to
cure you is marriage&mdash;and it does generally&mdash;a
ring dissolved in syrup night
and morning; kind of quinine, you
know; takes away the shivering and
gives you a headache.”</p>

<p>His face was whitening with disapproval,
and she burst, as she caught a
glimpse of it, into a gust of laughter.</p>

<p>“Shocking, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a matter of taste,” he remarked,
with a further twist of his nose,
to indicate that its flavor, at least in his
mouth, was nasty. It is never the hangman
can joke when he is hung.</p>

<p>She looked at him, with her head
tilted over her plate, and a slow, broad
smile.</p>

<p>“You’ll do!” she said. “But you
know even your eight pearls won’t run
to quite all that&mdash;every time.”</p>

<p>He moved impatiently on his chair as
she raised her champagne glass and
peered mockingly at him across its yellow
brim.</p>

<p>She set it down with a laugh.</p>

<p>“My!” she exclaimed; “what a row
they are making upstairs! Come along,
I believe they are dancing.”</p>

<p>She went up three steps at a time, but
Veynes followed more slowly. He
feared he was sickening for the fever.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The woman’s orbit&mdash;in a civil state&mdash;is,
like that of other celestial bodies,
either annular or elliptic.</p>

<p>Those of the circle are orderly satellites,
turning an eternal sameness to the
attraction they patrol, and as incapable
of suiting themselves to a suitor, or of
varying their reflection of his passion
to a man’s requirements, as of coyness
with its quoted sunlight is the cold face
of the moon.</p>

<p>And the moons are many. They rise,
wax, wane; are new, old and eclipsed;
pass by progressive phases of the familiar
to the lean crescent of contempt,
with a constancy in decrepitude&mdash;speaking
amorously&mdash;which cannot only be
followed, but&mdash;foretold.</p>

<p>And those of the ellipse? They, too,
revolve, but come, enkindled, from the
unknown night, torn with fantastic
splendors toward their sun&mdash;drawn into
him, it may be, by his spell, or past
him with unsolved desires, yet bent to
him still&mdash;dying out, darkened, into the
empty way, spent, speedless, splendorless;
a danger to orderly patrollers of
an orbit, and a possible acquisition for
any new system of superior attractions;
being, at their ebb, but weak and idle
wanderers&mdash;inconstant, easily attached;
though at other times superb, imperious;
yet malign portents to the thatched
propriety that lives in fear of sparks.</p>

<p>Such divide the sex, the passive and
the passionate; the reflectors and the
inflamed. Men love the second, but
they wed the first&mdash;moon, not comet,
and they do well. For men prefer comfort
to coronation, and like the easy
sense of lordship which a satellite confers;
for there is something soothing
to mortal vanity in centripetal rigors
when oneself is the center sought; and,
though men disparage the sameness
which they wive, they would be but ill
content with its reverse.</p>

<p>Veynes knew as much; or, rather,
knew that as much was known. He
had, morever, warning in the fate of a
too recent ancestor, who, allying himself
to one of the comet kind&mdash;the
frame of her picture still hung empty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in evicted memorial, at the court&mdash;came
to unrecounted grief. So, fearing
his desires, and the failure of his desires,
and the outcome of either, he told
himself, shaking his head with that unvalorous
and how-to-perform-I-wot-not
wisdom of youth, that his refined perceptions
had been estranged by Miss
Rosamond’s too candid lack of quality.
Which may have been; for our refined
perceptions are so often only an injected
opiate, in spite of which our heart
still beats and sickens. Yet he shook
his head sadly. He had his father to
consider; he had the estate to consider;
he had his name to consider; but, firstly
and finally, he had himself. And, alas!
it takes more than honor, piety and
pride together to make a man forget
that. And a young man in especial.
For we are very practical when young,
and only fight the good fight for a substantial
share in the plunder; we ask
what a man will <i>get</i> in exchange for his
soul.</p>

<p>Veynes fought it, there is that to his
credit; and it is pleasant to remember
that, of all his obligations, duty to his
father died the hardest; sheer tenderness
for the old man’s hopes often
wringing from him a resolve to conquer
passion and wed a pedigree. But
the resolutions of the young are, happily,
impermanent; and this kind beyond
the rest, being written in acid, eats its
way out&mdash;through the stuff of our wills.</p>

<p>So it was that, in spite of this clamoring
chorus of expediencies, the small
voice which claims in every man the
justice of joy made itself heeded, and
Miss Merlin received an offer of marriage;
which, stung by South’s indifference,
she allowed herself to accept.</p>

<p>After that, of course, the deluge!&mdash;and,
thinking to float it out the better
on a certificate of marriage, Veynes
took Miss Rosamond to the registrar.</p>

<p>Then, with Lady Veynes in her prettiest
frock, they went down together to
the court, and crossing, with a sense
of diplomacy, from the station by a
field path into the French garden, which
lay behind the western wing of the
house, Veynes left his wife and advanced
alone.</p>

<p>He was some time gone, and the lady,
tired at last of the flowers, the reflector,
and the mossy sundial, and tempted by
the cropped turf, turned to her ancient
consolation for leisures that were too
long; so that the first thing which met
Veynes’ eye on his return was her lithe
figure, in fawn and gold, doing a little
melancholy dance between the scarlet
flower beds.</p>

<p>The sight did not sweeten his temper;
it emphasized too loudly reproaches
which hummed still against his ears.
Even those red blossoms, which had
lived in their mute livery so many years
about the court, might have been too
surprised to recognize, by the swift,
small feet that brushed their petals, a
future mistress.</p>

<p>As Veynes drew near, the dance became
a little more flamboyant, still further
ruffling him; the spaces of dainty
petticoat seemed to enlarge his grievance.</p>

<p>“Well?” she inquired, loftily, as he
approached, dropping into an attitude.</p>

<p>“Well,” he echoed, gruffly, “you
needn’t fool about for the benefit of the
gardeners. He won’t see you.”</p>

<p>His tone sided with the rebuff, and
brought a flush of color to her face.
She had been his wife only a night and a
day.</p>

<p>“All right,” she replied, simply. “I
will see <i>him</i>; and meanwhile the gardeners
are very welcome.”</p>

<p>He flung himself into a seat. “Just
as you please,” he grunted; “only he
doesn’t know you’re here.”</p>

<p>She took no heed to the hint, but
walked in her deliberate fashion to the
edge of the lawn; then she turned and
came back more slowly.</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?” she asked
her husband.</p>

<p>His arms were stretched along the
top of the seat, and he was staring
gloomily at the house. He did not look
up.</p>

<p>“I told him I was married. He nearly
bucked out of his chair, and looked as
frightened as if he’d heard I was dead.
So I said: ‘To an actress,’ and he put
his face into his hands and cried.”</p>

<p>“What a soft!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, anything you please! He said
some other things that were a bit
harder.”</p>

<p>“About me?”</p>

<p>“About the whole sickening concern.
Said I might go to the deuce my own
way, but it shouldn’t be through the
Court; and that while he lived&mdash;which
wouldn’t be for long&mdash;the old place
should know only its own sort of people.”</p>

<p>“What sort is that?”</p>

<p>“People of birth and breeding, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“I see! Like Lord Egglesham, for
instance, who shared the honeymoon
with his fond parents; or Aubrey Beauthair,
who gets fuzzy before ladies.
Well, I’m going to show your father
what a person is like who has been
neither born nor bred; I dare say it will
interest him. Shall I say that you’ll
dine here?”</p>

<p>“Say what you like,” he growled.</p>

<p>She turned again toward the long
west wing of the great house, which
glowed above the box hedges, warm and
red with sunlight above its clinging
roses.</p>

<p>Her heart was not so brave as her
words, but it carried her past the powdered
footman with the air of a duchess,
as she gave her name, though she read
doubts in his curdling face as to her reception,
and shared them herself. But
therein she wronged a man too proud to
let any woman suffer a slight in his own
house; and in due time the heavily curtained
library door was opened, and the
earl entered and bowed.</p>

<p>“I am Lady Veynes,” said his visitor,
quietly. She felt a sudden kindness
and pity for the frail, bent old
man, who was still as white as his son
had reported.</p>

<p>He bowed again.</p>

<p>“I was waiting in the garden when
my hus&mdash;your son was in here,” she
went on, simply; “he came out and
told me all about it. I’m very sorry.
I mean I’m very sorry it is so bad for
you. Your son said you’d wish him
better dead. I hope you won’t. He’s
an awfully good son; he thinks no end
of you; and he’s outside now tremendously
cut up.”</p>

<p>Lord Egham made no sign, but he
was looking in the woman’s face.</p>

<p>“I’ve never thought about it,” she
continued, naïvely, “but I didn’t suppose
there was such a difference between
people as&mdash;as there seems to be.
I thought if a man’s wife was pure and
true to him, and loved him, he got all
his change&mdash;I mean all he stood to;
isn’t that it? You don’t think so, but
I didn’t know that. I didn’t know anything
about you, you see,” she explained,
with warming sympathy; “you
were only the Earl of Something, and
it didn’t seem to matter much what an
earl felt; he didn’t seem quite human;
it really didn’t seem as if he <i>could</i> feel
so very much. But you see you do.”</p>

<p>The earl bent his head gravely, but
there was the ghost of a smile about
his drawn lips.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, with a little gesture
which opened her arms and seemed pathetically
to expose herself, “I am sorry
to be here to trouble you; I didn’t come
for that. I suppose you think I was
very glad to catch your son, and his
title, and money, and things; but I
wasn’t. I didn’t want them; I don’t
know what you do with them; but I
wanted to belong somewhere. I’m all
by myself, you see,” with a little isolating
wave of her hand, “and that’s dreary
enough at times, especially for a
woman.”</p>

<p>She waited a moment to allow the
earl to fill the gap, but he did not. He
was watching her intently.</p>

<p>“I came down here with my husband,”
she continued at length, with an
air of embroidering the interval; “he
didn’t want me to come in to&mdash;to bother
you, but I felt I must. I don’t want
you to fall out with him; you haven’t
had him back so long, I know; it seems
pretty rough on you every way; but if
you can’t take us both on, I’ll go. Of
course I can’t go for good, but it’ll
seem good enough, I dare say; I can
keep out of the way, and you can have
him to yourself; and you won’t have to
apologize to all your friends for his
making a fool of himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>There was some gentle irony in her
voice, and it wavered as she concluded:</p>

<p>“I’ve been pretty lonely before, but
it was never anything like this; and if
I’d known how bad you’d take me I’d
have stayed so.”</p>

<p>Her nervousness and her desire for
simple expression soaked her speech in
a kind of sweetened slanginess, from
which, usually, she was able to wring
out her thoughts into very clean English.
Slang was, in fact, the charcoal
outline of most of her talk, but it was
generally concealed by the color. The
latter she supplied on this occasion in
person. She was a very pretty woman,
and seemed able to look her prettiest
at will; the need for beauty painting it
freshly on her face. She had the dancer’s
trick, too, of seeming to float
above her anchored feet, like a butterfly
with folded wings.</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes, which
aided the apparent sincerity in her tone,
though, indeed, she was sufficiently
sorry for the silent man before her to
make it a very solid counterfeit of the
fact; but the tears were come of disappointment
and hurt pride.</p>

<p>However, to a man, the tear in a
woman’s eye is always a tear, a salt
tear; and in such eyes they looked well
enough, and ill enough, to warm a colder
heart than was in Lord Veynes’
father; for age is tenderer to beauty
than youth, being a wayfarer among
flowers which the other wears; besides,
it sees at sundown, and lips seem redder
and eyelids sadder when they face
the sunset.</p>

<p>Lord Egham made a step forward,
and offered her a seat. And Rosamond
murmured to herself: “I’ve come to
stay!”</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>But she had not; at least not so speedily
as she supposed. She returned that
evening to town with her husband, and
crossed the Channel the following day
for a honeymoon, which was rather
endured than desired. But the earl
proved, in the end, gentleman and philosopher
enough&mdash;synonyms for gracious
acceptance of the inevitable&mdash;to
make his bow to necessity, and take
fate and the prettiest lady in London
on his arm.</p>

<p>South had heard from her twice,
from Venice and Corfu; long, trivial,
ill-spelt letters, lined with a secret wistfulness
he had not perceived, under the
brave talk of travel.</p>

<p>He received the second while away
from town, and only learned, on his
arrival in the end of October, that Lady
Veynes and her husband had called
some weeks earlier, and had inquired
the date of his return.</p>

<p>He was puzzled by their presence at
that time in London, and a telegram
which came from the Court a few
days later did not aid his enlightenment.
It ran: “Please be at home this
evening.&mdash;R.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;V.” He had indulged
in the unusual extravagance of a box
at the Variety for the amusement of
some country friends who were doing
London in the dull season, and was most
anxious to entertain them; yet he provided
a substitute and an excuse without
a murmur, and dined early by himself.
Then, the day having been close
and warm, he pushed his chair beside
the roasted greenness on the balcony
and sat looking down idly, in the early
evening, from behind the thick stone
balusters upon the square.</p>

<p>The sky was clear above the mulled
October mist, and a few pale stars had
appeared already, weak and white as
city children; there was a reek of heated
brick, and an odor of brown leaves
drifted from the park with the damp
smell of its autumn water.</p>

<p>The roar of traffic had died down; it
was always quieter there in the fall,
and a piano-organ in the Palace Road
seemed to play in an exhausted air. A
clatter of wheels crushed through its
tune as a hansom shot round the narrow
entry and rattled across the quad.</p>

<p>The panels clanged, and South could
hear the click of small-heeled shoes
upon the pavement. The pause which
might cover a payment, the long wheep
of the whip, the sudden clash of hoofs,
the thin clang of the bell below&mdash;all
seemed borne up to him with abnormal
clearness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>He sat where he was till the door
opened and Lady Veynes was announced;
then he rose, outlined in the
open window against the sky, and called,
as his landlord retired, for the lamps.
Rosamond walked across to the balcony
and stood beside him, gazing absently
into the square; then she turned
her head quickly and looked up into his
eyes. There was an urgent smile in
hers which was almost an appeal, but
his in return seemed to satisfy it, for
she stole out her hand and caught his
arm lightly above the elbow.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” he inquired.</p>

<p>She looked over his shoulder as the
man entered and placed a lamp on the
table; and when he had retired she
stepped across the room and snapped
it out.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you called for
it,” she said. “Was it to tint the proprieties?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” he replied, regarding
her, “but I’m afraid it won’t.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. I’m going to sit in
your seat here by the window; pull another
beside it.”</p>

<p>He did as he was told, and she laid
her arms limply along those of the
chair, leaned back and sighed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know why I’m here?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m going away.”</p>

<p>“From what?”</p>

<p>“From the Court, and my husband,
and his excellent father, and everything!
I’m sick of it all.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess? Because I’m not
one of them. I’m a kind of curiosity
in the house; people come to stare at
me, they do, really; possibly they think
I’ll kick their hats off at afternoon tea,
or pass them the bread and butter on
my toe; I don’t know. But I don’t
mind that so much, it’s the feeling that
I mustn’t do these things because I
can. If I was a real lady I might do
anything; but because I’m not I must
do nothing. Smile, sigh and say good-by;
and be a pretty piece of furniture
to decorate the rooms and support my
husband. But I won’t. I wasn’t made
on castors.”</p>

<p>“Well?” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to run&mdash;on wheels!”</p>

<p>“Are they unkind to you?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not; they’re kind, rather
too kind. I mean they make you feel
it’s a moral obligation to treat such an
outsider humanely. Of course they can’t
help it, and it’s nasty of me to mention
it, but I can’t help feeling it,
either, and it makes me mad. Everything
does down there, from morning
prayers, with half a squadron of bluey-white
servants on red chairs, to the
candles at ten o’clock, and to bed with
what appetite you mayn’t. And I’ve
<i>got</i> to do it! If I suggest anything
fresh and sensible they look at me as
if I were a sort of missing link. So I
shut up and scream inside me and wish
for something to bite. Put your hand
here.”</p>

<p>He smiled at the sudden change, but
laid his hand on the arm of her seat, and
she closed her gloved fingers over it.</p>

<p>“Do you want it to bite?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. Jim!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Do you think me a fool?”</p>

<p>“No; I understand.”</p>

<p>There was a breadth in his tone which
comforted her.</p>

<p>“You said: Marry him,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did; perhaps <i>I</i> was the fool;
but I didn’t say ‘for three months.’”</p>

<p>“Three? Six!”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Five, then; I <i>ought</i> to know.”</p>

<p>A certain sharpness in her registry
seemed to give it claims to be considered
calendar. South looked up at
her quickly, and she flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>“Well, five,” he said; “hardly time
for a very exhaustive study of the married
state.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not the married state,” she
explained, slowly, looking out over the
square. “I shouldn’t mind being married&mdash;married
to a man. I’m married
to a house.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very good house.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it is; but I’m not a snail,
and can’t stand having it on my back;’
I wasn’t born under family bricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>“And what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to leave them.”</p>

<p>“And why did you come here?”</p>

<p>She turned her head and flashed a
shy glance across his eyes.</p>

<p>“I thought you might be leaving,
too.”</p>

<p>She looked away as she said it, and
he did not immediately reply. Presently
she loosened her fingers from his,
and laid her hand in her lap. She
broke the silence sharply.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” she said;
“why do you suppose I’ve come here,
ever? Do you fancy it’s for the pleasure
of a little talk? Why, I’ve gone
home sometimes clinching my hands to
keep from crying, and hating you fit
to kill you.”</p>

<p>South sighed.</p>

<p>“Have you?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have! It’s horrid of me, I
know, because you’ve tried to be kind,
mostly; but being kind is worse than
anything, sometimes.”</p>

<p>She turned toward him, and through
the shadow upon her face her eyes
glowed molten, as lead grows red in the
ladle.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “you may forgive
me; I haven’t tried to be kind. I
thought all the kindness on the other
side. Your very coming was a concession.”</p>

<p>“To what?”</p>

<p>“To a man unknown and immaterial;
to the genius of futility.”</p>

<p>“Genius of fiddlesticks! Why did
you suppose I came?”</p>

<p>South swung his head in pendulous
ignorance.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t mind my blushes,
it’s too dark to see them. And when I
startled you with Veynes’ proposal,
and bored you to admire my figure,
and my frock, and everything <i>he</i> might
be master of, was that a concession?”</p>

<p>“To my stupidity?” he parried.</p>

<p>“No; the genius for futility&mdash;a woman’s!”
she said, with drawn bitterness.
“All the same, if you guessed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, guessing!” he shrugged.</p>

<p>“No! You’re no such fool. Are
you?”</p>

<p>She leaned somewhat away from him
with a suggestion of disdain.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, slowly, rising, “I
did not guess; I knew.”</p>

<p>She heard him pacing in the dusky
room behind her, and stop at last before
the fireplace. He laid one hand
over the other and pressed them with
his forehead against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Cries, shrill and hoarse, drifted in
with the darkness from the Palace
Road; the evening’s pennyworth of
print in shouted headlines, the details
draining incoherently into the night.</p>

<p>“Won’t you say you’re sorry?” she
inquired, presently.</p>

<p>“For you?”</p>

<p>“No, for yourself. Mightn’t we both
have done better?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done nothing,” he murmured,
between his arms.</p>

<p>“It’s not a fine confession,” she
laughed, curtly; “but you chose.”</p>

<p>“Between what?”</p>

<p>“Between these arms and mine,” she
said, slowly, tapping the chair; “between
horsehair and flesh and blood.
And you chose the horsehair.”</p>

<p>“It’s permanent,” he retorted, somewhat
piqued, “and it hasn’t a pulse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she sighed, “it’s a ‘dead-sure
thing’&mdash;dead and sure, they’re
about the same; you can’t reckon up
things that live; and, as for a pulse,
it beats faster for other things than
fever, you know, and it’s not only the
doctor who feels it.”</p>

<p>“Feels it flag?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother you!” she exclaimed. “If
all men were such chickens, who’d ever
marry?”</p>

<p>“The women,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“No, I think they’d be too wise,” she
said.</p>

<p>He laughed, an echo of hers; there
was not much mirth between them.</p>

<p>“That last day I came here,” she continued,
presently, with a musing air,
“you might have said more than you
did.”</p>

<p>“More?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more for me; something to
pretend you couldn’t see me; I felt
stripped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled at the fire-dogs, remembering
her dress.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, a man never does. Some men,
you know, lie to a woman to be rid of
her, lie about their love and about their
life; say it’s heartbreaking, but impossible;
one forgives that&mdash;it’s craven but
it’s kind; but one can’t forgive the men
who lie by saying nothing, merely to
be rid of her the sooner, when she might
go comforted, and only a little slower,
by just one whisper of the love they
have.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she sighed, “we never do,
we women. We pray not to sometimes;
pray to be kept blind, dull, doting.” She
laughed abruptly. “Well, I wish you’d
said you loved me then, Jim; even
though I might have hugged you.
Couldn’t you say it now?”</p>

<p>“It’s not lawful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she sighed again, but reminiscently,
“it’s not lawful; but it would
be kinder and better than many things
that are. Besides, you might rise in
my esteem.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said, smiling, pushing
himself erect. “I think I’ll stay as I
am. I’m high enough now to feel dizzy
sometimes when you commend me. The
question is, where are <i>you</i> going to
stay?”</p>

<p>“To-night at the Grand; my things
are there. To-morrow I shall be across
the Channel.”</p>

<p>She swung her chair round toward
the room.</p>

<p>“Am I going alone?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, decidedly. “I want you
to wait a day.”</p>

<p>“With you?”</p>

<p>“No, but for me. I’m going down
to the Court.”</p>

<p>“To give me away?”</p>

<p>He had been staring at the dark
mirror. He turned his face slowly toward
her with a smile.</p>

<p>“I suppose I need not deny that,” he
said. “I shall not give you away, even
for your good; you know that.”</p>

<p>“Then for what are you going?”</p>

<p>“You’re making a mistake,” he said,
ignoring her question. “If you must
leave your husband, you should go by
the front door; it’s a higher class of
exit, pleasanter, more modern, and more
effective; besides, it prevents the good
man running after you with a posse of
detectives.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll do that?” she
groaned.</p>

<p>“Doubtless; perhaps offer a reward.
Now, to avoid that and live secure,
you’ll grant me a day’s grace, won’t
you&mdash;and wait?”</p>

<p>“I shall be trusting you,” she said.</p>

<p>“And now you’d better go. I have
to catch the nine-fifteen, isn’t it? And
I’m very certain you’ve had no dinner.”</p>

<p>“Besides, appearances!” she mocked.</p>

<p>“Yes; or non-appearances, as at present,”
he replied, unruffled. “If you’ll
wait I’ll call a hansom.”</p>

<p>But she said she would go down with
him; and after a glance at her frock, a
traveling one, before the mirror, opened
the door as he relit the lamp. He followed
her along the dusk of the passage
to show her the way, but she
stopped abruptly on the edge of the
stairs, throwing back her head so that
it nearly struck him.</p>

<p>“Kiss me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, quietly; “you’re not
mine to kiss.”</p>

<p>She bent her right arm back with a
quick movement behind his head, and
drew his lips down to her face.</p>

<p>“Ah! if it were only a question of
possession,” she sighed, as she pressed
them to her own.</p>

<p>She turned on the stairs and looked
back at him.</p>

<p>“You don’t resent it?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because you’re not mine to kiss,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s your affair,” he smiled.</p>

<p>At the hall door she suggested that,
being bound for Waterloo, he might
accompany her.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of you,” he said.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be,” she murmured.
“I’m done.”</p>

<p>In the end she waited while he packed
a bag, and they drove together under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
withered planes through the park to her
hotel. But she declined to alight.</p>

<p>“You promised to be good,” he reminded
her.</p>

<p>“I’m good&mdash;good as gold&mdash;I wouldn’t
touch you for the world, but I’m going
to see you off. Jim, do let me! I’ll
come straight back and eat no end of
dinner; I will, really! But I must say
good-by to you there!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t understand; it’s
a presentiment.”</p>

<p>“Presentiments are all stuff.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; so are women; but one
has them both in&mdash;hansoms. Jim!”</p>

<p>“All right; but only to the station,
not inside!”</p>

<p>She assented, and they parted, finally,
with a feminine complexity of farewell,
under the glass-roofed entry;
South arriving on the platform to discover
that the nine-fifteen had been advanced
ten minutes since the first of
the month, and that, thanks to Rosamond’s
presentiments, he had lost the
last train to Veyne St. Mary’s by a few
seconds.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Vexed as he was with the woman who
had barred the way, he was almost
minded, driving back, to acquaint her
with his failure.</p>

<p>The inclination was perverse and not
in his sanest manner; but her presence
had overpowered him that night as an
inhaled narcotic; something diffusive
in her strong, warm beauty, filling his
room, had numbed him as he breathed it.</p>

<p>But his senses came again in the
night air, and he kept on, after crossing
the river, by the abbey, and his
homeward way.</p>

<p>He had left his key behind him, and
learned, on entering, that a gentleman
awaited him above.</p>

<p>“Who?” he inquired, and was told
Lord Veynes.</p>

<p>“Said as ’e couldn’t afford to miss
you, sir; so ’e’d wait, and take ’is
chance.”</p>

<p>South always faced trouble, but he
went more slowly upstairs. The door
of his room was ajar, the lamp had been
relit upon the table, and soused in its
shaded dome of light was the figure of
a man, stretched along the big chair
before the fire. Veynes did not respond
to his host’s hail of welcome; his eyes
were staring into the shadowy mirror;
and his face reflected there was like a
ghostlight on the glass.</p>

<p>Knowing something of his visitor’s
moods, South took no notice of his silence,
but, drawing a chair beside him,
brought his hand down on the other’s
fingers with an exclamation of abusive
kindliness.</p>

<p>One speaks of words frozen on the
lips, but those seemed frozen in the
air, ringing with an awful icy vibration
in the silent room, as South started
back, dumb with horror, for the hand
upon which his had fallen was damp
with the grip of death.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Of the days which followed, South
could never give a complete account. A
stranger to sorrow, almost, indeed, to
every ruinous emotion, the scenes he
witnessed seemed to alter the spacing
of the hours so that no two were of a
length.</p>

<p>The noise and crush of daily life were
suddenly muted, as though death had
closed a door and shut them out; and
within, behind the bolted silence of
despair, were tears, sad talk, mourning
darkness, and the melancholy business
of the dead, haunted, as with pale marsh
lights, by the pitiful inquisition in the
dead eyes which he had closed.</p>

<p>His consolation, in that dreary time,
was that he bore half the burden of its
grief.</p>

<p>The earl knew nothing of his son’s
death but what the doctors could tell
him, for Lady Veynes, with a curious,
but to her a natural, discretion had kept
the motive of her movements a secret
even from her maid.</p>

<p>So the two chief agents in the tragedy
carried the weight of it between them,
and alone heard the inquest verdict of
“an overstrained heart,” with the desolate
knowledge of all it meant&mdash;South
with dry eyes, so dry that their color
seemed faded, and hers so wet that they
seemed mixed with their tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>He had feared once, only once, that
she would forget the righteous necessities
of her secret, and admit another,
with cruel penitence, to its miserable
pale.</p>

<p>It was on her first entry to the room
where the body was lying, the earl sitting
by it, his face almost as gray and
sharp as that of the dead. One of his
hands was on his son’s, the other crept
presently to Rosamond’s golden hair.
She had dropped on her knees beside
the bed, her eyes buried in the coverlet,
her arms flung out across it, moaning
an inarticulate torrent of useless
tenderness, and penitence, and despair.
Her head was shaken by its sorrow like
a yellow leaf, but the old man’s grief
ran silently, as a stream that dries upon
its stones.</p>

<p>That was the one occasion when
South had distrusted the charity and
shrewdness of her discretion; after that
his doubts were at rest. She was everything
a woman could be who would
not sink her duties in sorrow, and South
often wondered what the earl would
have done without her.</p>

<p>He had beside ample reason for surprise.
Her delicate little performance
as a woman of affairs for the benefit of
the lawyers, her equally fine and far
more difficult personation before the
family as lady paramount, were revelations
of an ability he had been indisposed
to admit.</p>

<p>He called it mummery to himself, but
there was a dreary earnestness and effort
in it which gave his slight the lie.
He would not see the whiteness of her
face, or the sorrow in her clouded eyes;
and for a curious reason, because her
grief left him, and it seemed with deliberate
intention, in the cold.</p>

<p>She bore it with a certain stiffness
of control as a burden she was too
proud to share, yet which bent her into
measured steps.</p>

<p>But South, who felt himself almost
an accessory to her fate, could better
have endured complaint; he would
sooner have been hated, so he told
himself.</p>

<p>So, since that memorable morning
when she had flung a crumb of toast
across the table at the gravity on his
face, gray as it was with its news, and,
afterward, in anguish and self-contempt,
laid her sobbing head among the breakfast
things, South had doubted everything
about her but her charm.</p>

<p>Yet her sorrow proved, as he was
finally to discover, exceedingly sincere;
it outlasted even his demands upon it;
but it lived, as all her clouds, in a windy
sky; and broke, and blew over.</p>

<p>Ere that, however, or the lightening
of her widow’s crape, a fresh link was
welded from her life, which gave the
sad earl a joy in his old age, and a
despot to Veynes Court.</p>

<p>South used to run down, sometimes,
on the summer evenings, to watch Lady
Veynes, the earl and his grandson playing
like three children in the dappled
sunlight on the lawn.</p>

<p>Or, at least, if there were other reasons
for his appearance, he was not on
thinking terms with them.</p>

<p>Lady Veynes was. She thought,
moreover, that his visits were far too
few.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>The Feminine Temperament</i><br />

<i>By</i> MRS. WILSON WOODROW</span></h2>

<div class="b1 figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i100a.png" width="578" height="180" alt="Conversations With Egeria, by Mrs. Wilson Woodrow" />
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/ii.png" width="124" height="122" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi">IT is delightful to talk
to a bishop,” smiled
Egeria; “it immediately
becomes a serious
duty to be frivolous.”</p>

<p>“And why, pray?”
The bishop looked
slightly bewildered.</p>

<p>“To afford you the pleasures of contrast.
To convince you from the start
that one woman does not seek priestly
counsel, nor intend to bore you with the
vagaries of her soul.”</p>

<p>The bishop smiled benignly, deprecatingly
and yet comprehendingly. He
even shook his head in paternal and
playful admonition.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know us,” Egeria assured
him. “A woman, if she is young, is
always either occupied with her heart
or her soul. When the one absorbs
her the other doesn’t. When she’s in
love she forgets all about her soul.
When she’s out of love she turns to it
again. Then she yearns for incense,
altar lights and a pale, young priest,
who is willing to devote time and prayer
to assuaging her spiritual doubts. She
doesn’t care in the least to be spiritually
directed by any well-fed, commonplace
parson with a fat wife and a pack of
rosy children. No, no, a wistful young
ascetic, with hollows under his eyes&mdash;wan
and worn with fasting and vigils.
She is perfectly aware that he has ultimately
not the ghost of a show; but she
is entirely willing that he shall have a
run for his money. In fact, she hopes
that the struggle may be keen and prolonged.
To play a game fish which is
putting up the fight of its life is infinitely
more exciting than to languidly
reel in the line and secure a victim
which has not made the least resistance.”</p>

<p>The bishop smiled tolerantly, tapping
his finger tips together. “Doubtless
correct, doubtless correct. Your
astuteness and intellectual acumen have
always elicited my admiration.”</p>

<p>A sparkle of annoyance brightened
Egeria’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Checkmate,” she murmured, with a
little bow of deference.</p>

<p>The bishop raised his brows innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know,” continued Egeria,
resentfully, “that there is one compliment
a woman never forgives, and that
is a tribute to her intellect at the expense
of her power of attraction. If
the lure the serpent taught her is vain,
then is her destiny barren, her desire
unfulfilled.”</p>

<p>“You deserved it,” laughed the
bishop; “but, dear lady, have you ever
paused to consider what a debt of gratitude
the world owes us? When I listen
to the outpourings of overcharged
feminine hearts, and read the diaries,
confessions and novels of innumerable
women, I am forced to the conclusion
that the church thoroughly understood
one of the first needs of a woman’s
heart when it established the confessional.
Then man, with his restless,
protesting conscience, did his best to
estrange you from the consolation, and,
in consequence, some eccentric, undisciplined
creature now and again voices
to the world the disorganized, hysterical
feminine emotions which should have
been discreetly sobbed into the ecclesiastical
ear, decently entombed in the silence
of the confessional.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>There was a faint wrinkle of displeasure
in Egeria’s brow. “Admitted,
admitted”&mdash;hastily&mdash;“and thank you
kindly, dear bishop, for your little criticism
of us. It makes it quite possible
for me to discuss the clergy if I wish.
Now I can ask, without being impertinent,
a question which has long puzzled
me. Why is it that you prelates and
the princes of the church are almost
invariably tolerant, delightfully broad-minded
and free from bias, while the
rank and file are so frequently strenuous
and discomposing? For instance,
last summer I was thrown, through
force of circumstances, with a sallow-faced,
stoop-shouldered preacher, who
always spoke of himself as ‘a minister
of the gospel.’ Whenever his dyspepsia
was especially severe he informed
his parishioners that he had girded on
his armor and was prepared to rebuke
evil in high places, and that he would
be recalcitrant to his trust if he did not
lift up his voice to condemn civic rottenness
and social degeneracy. His
wife was ‘an estimable lady,’ with the
figure of a suburbanite who only wears
stays in the evening, and a pronounced
taste for the clinging perfume of moth
balls. No children having blessed their
union, they decided to adopt some definite
aim in life. They were talking it
over once when I was present.</p>

<p>“‘There are the sick and the poor; I
am sure there are plenty of them,’ suggested
the lady.</p>

<p>“Her husband looked at her scornfully,
and coldly remarked that <i>that</i>
field was full of reapers.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, you mean to stand up openly
in the pulpit and rebuke the rich men
who make their money in queer ways!’
she exclaimed, excitedly.</p>

<p>“‘And offend half my wealthy parishioners
by branding them as thieves
on insufficient evidence?’ he thundered.
‘Are you insane?’</p>

<p>“Finally, however, being a shrewd
creature, he solved the problem and incidentally
won for himself a great deal
of gratuitous advertising. They organized
a society for the suppression of
bridge&mdash;aware that the public loves sensational
details regarding women of
position; the insidious cocktail&mdash;the
public delights to know that the social
leaders look too often upon the wine
when it’s red; ostracising divorcées&mdash;women
thus having the sanction of
Heaven for attacking their own sex.
Oh, it was a holy crusade in a teapot,
and made him quite famous; and, bishop,
what do you think was the motto of
the organization?”</p>

<p>The bishop shook his head. Mild
curiosity was in his eyes; but the shake
of his head was distinctly reproving.</p>

<p>“The watchword chosen,” chuckled
Egeria, “was, ‘Neither do I condemn
thee.’ Now, bishop, tell me, please,
what makes the difference between his
type of man and yours?”</p>

<p>A humorous twinkle shone in the
bishop’s eye, then he leaned forward
and whispered one word in Egeria’s
ear: “Money.”</p>

<p>She laughed, and then returned to
her muttons. “But, really, quite under
the rose, do you not become fearfully
bored sometimes by the various manifestations
of the feminine temperament?”</p>

<p>“It may be a trifle self-conscious, a
little inclined to regard itself pathologically,”
admitted the bishop, with
caution.</p>

<p>“It is frequently yellow,” said Egeria.
decisively. “Why don’t you clergymen
and novelists occasionally tell us
the truth?”</p>

<p>“We must fill our churches and sell
our books, I suppose,” returned the
bishop, half whimsically, half regretfully.
“What would you say, Lady
Egeria, if we put you in orders, and
disregarding St. Paul’s advice, let you
occupy the pulpit? Would you thunder
denunciations at poor, defenseless
women?”</p>

<p>“I’d have a fine time,” cried Egeria
her eyes alight. “I would do what
you sermonizers and novel writers
haven’t the courage to do&mdash;just tell
them the truth about themselves. Chide
them for their frivolities and extravagances
and vanities? Not I. They
don’t care a straw for that. No, no,
I should have a new evangel and a new
text. It should be: ‘Play the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
gamely, and don’t whine if you lose.’
Now, bishop, confess that you never
meet a strange woman that you do not
observe a speculative gleam in her eye
which long experience has taught you
to interpret as: ‘How soon can I tell
him my troubles?’”</p>

<p>“Poor ladies! You have so many,”
sighed the bishop, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Of course we have, we multiply
them by three. To sedulously observe
all tragic and harrowing anniversaries
is a part of our religion. ‘It’s just five
years ago to-day since Edwin left me
for another,’ she says, mournfully, and
then, shrouding herself in gloom, lives
over each poignant, past moment. If
anyone ask the cause of her dejected
demeanor, she murmurs, in a sad, sweet
voice: ‘It is an anniversary. Would
you like to hear of my grief?’</p>

<p>“But what does a man do? He says:
‘Jove! It’s just a year ago to-morrow
since Jemima was run down by an automobile.
I must keep myself well
amused or it may be a depressing occasion.’</p>

<p>“Seriously, bishop, if I were you, I’d
have a phonograph in my study, and
the moment a woman set foot within
the door it should begin that good old
hymn: ‘Go bury thy sorrow, the world
hath its share.’”</p>

<p>“But what can the poor things do,”
asked the bishop, “if they may not turn
to their clergyman for consolation and
comfort?”</p>

<p>“Twang on Emerson’s iron string:
‘Trust thyself.’ Why always twine
about a pole, like a limp pea vine, and
flop on the ground the minute the upholding
stick is withdrawn? Imagine
the emotions of the pole, if it were sentient!
At first it would say: ‘Delicate,
dainty pea vine, lean on me, the clasp
of your myriad tendrils fills me with
rapture. How sweet is your adorable
dependence!’ But in time: ‘Oh!
stifling, smothering pea vine, I am suffocated
by your deadening passivity.
Would I could tear myself free from
your throbbing tendrils.’”</p>

<p>“You evidently believe in the dead
burying their dead,” said the bishop,
meditatively.</p>

<p>“No sounder philosophy was ever enjoined
on a living world. Let the dead&mdash;dead
pasts, dead lives, dead loves,
dead memories&mdash;bury their dead. Ah,
bishop, the great art of life is the art
of forgetting.”</p>

<p>“You, Madame Egeria, are inclined
to philosophize.”</p>

<p>“Sir, do not remind me of it! When
we offer sacrifices at the altar of laughter,
you may look for gray hairs and
crows’ feet. Tears and passion belong
to youth: that season of fleeting and exquisite
joys, of tragic and fugitive
griefs, of tempestuous and restless longings.
Youth, with the passionate voice
of Maurice de Guerin, cries eternally:
‘The road of the wayfarer is a joyous
one. Ah, who shall set me adrift upon
the waters of the Nile?’”</p>

<p>“And in maturity we learn to fold
our hands and stop our ears and take
refuge in the commonplace.” The
bishop’s tone was tinged with bitterness.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, no!” Egeria was vehement.
“We learn that the Nile, with its
dream-haunted shores, flows by our
door; that wherever a patch of sunlight
falls is beauty, wherever a morning-glory
blows is art.”</p>

<p>The bishop fell in with her mood.
“That is it. Maturity is nothing if it
is not expansion.</p>

<span class="iq">“’Tis life of which our nerves are scant.<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>He loved to quote.</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Egeria, “‘more life,

experience, more of the dreams that
scale the stars, more of the splendid,
inexorable life of earth. But”&mdash;looking
at him doubtfully&mdash;“we are getting
horribly didactic and prosy, and we are
a thousand miles away from the feminine
temperament.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything left of it?” inquired
the bishop, mildly.</p>

<p>Egeria ignored him. “You have only
expressed yourself guardedly, while I
have talked and talked,” she complained.</p>

voice&mdash;“I am like the old Englishman

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE I
went away
from
Agonquitt
I was not,
even by the
most egotistic
stretch of my imagination, a very important
or an overwhelmingly popular
person in the community. The girls
from the village did not swarm out to
the farm to see me; they did not hang
upon my words with reverent attention.
Even during the two years when I was
at college, my holidays were not periods
of public rejoicing; my clothes were
not copied or my style of hairdressing
regarded with imitative admiration.</p>

<p>But ever since I went to New York
the attitude of my acquaintances has
changed. At first I was touched and
flattered by the interest which all my
old companions took in me when I came
home; gradually, however, it glimmered
upon my consciousness that it
was not myself, but the glamour of the
great city, which drew them&mdash;as though
the atmosphere of New York were a
tangible thing, and shreds of it clung to
me through the long journey down into
this remote country. I think I was a
little more touched, though not so flattered,
when I learned this; there is
something pathetic to the initiated in
the eager wonderment and awe of the
neophyte.</p>

<p>Sometimes the girls have asked my
advice, confiding to me their yearnings
to leave home, to make “careers” for
themselves in the world. And when I
try&mdash;as perhaps I too often do&mdash;to discourage
them, they look at me reproachfully,
mutely accusing me of a
selfish refusal to share with them pleasures
and glories. They talk of the theaters,
the opera, books, pictures, the
glittering press of life, as
though a ticket to New York
insured one these things. I
talk of loneliness and discomfort,
of the pinch of
poverty. They speak of enlarged
horizons; and I of
the hall bedrooms which
would bound the outlook of most of
them. They glow with the thought of
new friendships; and I dash their ardor
with tales of isolation, of snubs in
the effort to escape isolation, of tawdry
relationships begun for the sake of
mere companionship. But their eyes
are always full of incredulity. And
sometimes, remembering the delights
which were no less a part of my life
in the big city than the depression, remembering
the wholesome joy of work,
the natural pride of feeling oneself an
integral part of the great onward-pressing
stream of life; yes, and remembering
the sweet and the bitter-sweet
that came to me there, I wonder if my
prohibitive wisdom is not a little hypocritical.
Would I myself forego any of
my New York experiences?</p>

<p>Sometimes it has seemed to me that
my own adventures&mdash;or lack of adventures&mdash;set
down as plainly and truthfully
as I can recall them, might be of
more illuminating, perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;of
more deterrent, effect than all my
spoken generalizations. For though my
existence had its peculiar features, rose
to its individual climaxes, yet in the
main it was typical&mdash;the duplicate in
most essentials of that of thousands and
thousands of young women, not greatly
gifted, who come to New York to seek
their fortunes.</p>

<p>I shall never forget how the whole
thing came about. I was in the poultry
yard, doctoring some of my chickens
for the pip, when I heard a great puffing
and chugging in the road. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the Hennens’ automobile, and instead
of dashing past the house, scattering
terror before it, it snorted itself to a
standstill before our old carriage block.
I knew that mother’s annual ordeal was
before her, and I half laughed as I went
on forcing the broilers’ throats open.</p>

<p>Mother hated the yearly visitation of
Mrs. Hennen with all the intensity of
her very gentle, very proud nature.
Thirty-five years before she and Letitia
Bland had been the rival belles of the
Agonquitt region, and the legend was
that Letty Bland had taken to her bed
for three days when mother’s engagement
to father was made known, and
that she went to visit relatives in Eastport
at the time of the marriage. After
a triumph like that, no wonder mother
hated the magnificent summer descent
upon her of Mrs. Letitia Hennen, widow
of the oil-field king, mother of
George Hennen, the banker, broker,
yachtsman and what not; of Mrs. Letitia
Hennen, owner of the feudal castle
on the shore three miles from the village,
whose splendors put to utter rout
the modest opulence of all the rest of
Agonquitt’s summer colony. I was always
sorry for mother at the season of
her recurrent Nemesis, and yet I was
always amused at the thought of time’s
revenges.</p>

<p>To-day, when I had finished doctoring
the broilers, I strolled into the
house and greeted the great lady. She
was a kind, stout, motherly soul&mdash;very
gorgeous in raiment, very imposing in a
white pompadour; her good-natured,
round face always looked forth half bewilderedly
between the effort of her
dressmaker and that of her hairdresser.
This time her eyes were frankly
wet as she took my hand and patted
it.</p>

<p>“And so you’ve lost your dear father,”
she said. “And you’ve come
home from college&mdash;what a pity, my
dear! And you’ve been down to Bangor
and learned stenography&mdash;what a brave
girl you are, your father’s own daughter&mdash;and
you’re selling broilers to the
hotel; why not to me, my child?”</p>

<p>Mother’s cheeks were pink with badly
suppressed mortification, her eyes
sparkled, her lips were on the quivering
point.</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much, Mrs.
Hennen,” I interposed, hastily, before
mother could say anything, “but the
Agonquitt House contracted for them
all. Next year&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I must do something for you,”
the dear, kind lady blundered on. “It’s
all too sad; it’s too like your dear father’s
own case. You’ve heard how he
had to come back from college to take
charge of the farm when his father had
the stroke, and he&mdash;your father, I
mean, dear, not your grandfather&mdash;had
so wanted to be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course Ellen knows all about
that,” interrupted mother, icily. “And
I would have done anything to spare her
the sacrifice”&mdash;her voice grew human
again&mdash;“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m sure she knows everything there
is to know already”&mdash;Mrs. Hennen
beamed, benignly. “And stenography!
My, my! Doesn’t it make you feel ignorant,
Marietta? And so you’re going
to get a position in Bangor or Portland,
your mother says, in the fall?”</p>

<p>I nodded. Mrs. Hennen looked at
me with an air of silly, puzzled admiration.
Suddenly she clapped her hands&mdash;the
fingers were like little bleached
sausages in the tight, white gloves.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” she cried. “You
shall be George’s private secretary.
His Miss O’Dowd is going to be married
in October. The very thing! I’ll
speak to him to-night.”</p>

<p>She puffed up, the kind lady, and
kept saying, “Not a word, not a word;
I won’t hear a word against it; not a
word, Marietta, not one, Ellen, my
dear.” And she panted off, leaving
mother on the verge of tears, and me
quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>“A favor from Letty Bland I will
not endure!” mother proclaimed. “I
will not endure her patronage.” Then
she broke down entirely and sobbed:
“Oh, I can’t stand in your way, my
poor little girl, and I can’t bear to let
you go so far from me.”</p>

<p>The end of the whole matter was that
the close of September found me on
the way to New York, warmly clad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the clothes over which mother had reddened
her pretty eyes and pricked her
pretty fingers, an emergency fund of a
hundred and twenty-five dollars&mdash;those
blessed broilers!&mdash;in a chamois bag between
my excellent woolens and my stout
muslins, a room in the Margaret Louisa
Home engaged for me for any period
up to a month. Our clergyman’s wife
had recommended that refuge, and
mother’s premonitions of battle, murder
and sudden death for me grew a little
less insistent when she had been finally
convinced that I could go almost without
change of cars from the safety of
Agonquitt to that most evangelical of
shelters.</p>

<p>Oh, the tremors, the breathlessness,
the excitement, of that journey! Oh,
the fairly dizzy rapture and pain of it!
I had a vision of streets brilliant with
lights, of a press of carriages, of shops,
flowers, buildings; of unknown faces,
each one the possibility of interest, the
invitation to adventure, and I exulted.
Then I saw the big, square house where
I had been born, shabbily in need of
paint; the lonely fields sloping away
from it, the woods of yellow birch and
pine, the lonely blue reaches of our
Northern bays, and my mother sitting
in her poor black frock alone by the
fire in the early evening. Then I strangled
sobs behind my clinched teeth.</p>

<p>My journey from Agonquitt had been
broken by one night’s stay in Portland
with our second cousins. Mother regarded
a sleeping car as an unpermissible
atrocity&mdash;and wider experience
compels me to share her views&mdash;and I
made the trip by daylight stages. No
one had paid any particular attention
to me; no adventure had paused by my
chair in the car. Nothing happened
until I emerged from the train into the
murky, glittering evening at the Grand
Central Station. Then for a few minutes
I was really dazed.</p>

<p>I had spurned the assistance of porters,
being forewarned of tips, and I
carried my bag through the yard toward
the street. There I gasped and nearly
reeled. Never had I heard such a
clamor, or seen such a whirl and tangle
of lights, such recklessness of darting
figures, such insistent greed of beckoning
fingers and whips.</p>

<p>“Keb, keb, keb, keb!” The maddening
din rang in my ears. “Keb, keb,
keb, keb!” The arms, the eyes, all
echoed the cry. “Keb, keb, keb,
keb&mdash;&mdash;” Beyond the barricade of
that shout there was tempest, turmoil,
clatter; I turned and fled backward toward
the train yard, which seemed to
me calm and sane now, though a few
minutes before it had been a smoking,
roaring understudy for Purgatory.
Never could I breast that tumultuous
tide of madness without.</p>

<p>Another train was unloading. I was
jostled by a great many persons who
had evidently determined to reach the
bedlam on the sidewalk in less than
half a second. I dodged. I looked for
a uniform which might remain stationary
long enough for me to reach it. I
saw one&mdash;baggage man, carriage starter,
train announcer, I didn’t know or
care what&mdash;I made a sidewise dash for
him and collided violently with a dress-suit
case, whose owner towered several
feet above. He muttered an apology,
I muttered an excuse, and then we both
stopped, to the damming of the torrential
haste behind us.</p>

<p>“Ellen Berwick!”</p>

<p>“Bob Mathews!”</p>

<p>Never had human face seemed to me
so friendly as this one. Never had
words sounded so honey-sweet as my
name ejaculated by a voice which, if
not lately familiar, was at least friendly
and recognizable. The Agonquitt
stamp was already the hall mark of
worth, of excellence, in my mind. And
Robert Mathews was Dr. Mathews’
son; no amount of Beaux-Arts-ing it,
no amount of rising-young-architect-ing
it, could alter that blessed fact.</p>

<p>“Where are you going? Why are
you here? Where is your mother? Oh,
you are, are you? To the Maggie Lou!
Why do I call it that? It’s a pet name
for an excellent institution given by its
intimate admirers. The George Hennens&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Questioning, answering, tossing information
back and forth as a Japanese
juggler might balls, he somehow managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
at the same time to deposit me and
my bag in a cab. I breathed a sigh of
relief to think that it was the driver’s
problem and not mine safely to cross
the noisy flood in front of the station.</p>

<p>Sometimes since then I have marveled
at the chance which caused me,
just down from Maine, to collide with
Bob Mathews, just in from New Rochelle.
But I have learned that it is a
miracle of frequent occurrence that
newcomers to Babylon should run upon
acquaintances. It is only the old residents
who go abroad day after day and
see no familiar face.</p>

<p>Should I have gone back to Agonquitt
in despair of Forty-second Street
if I had not met Bob? I suppose not.
But how meeting him simplified the
problem of reaching the Margaret
Louisa!</p>

<p>“I’ve a dinner engagement with a fellow
at the club to-night, or I should
carry you off to dine with me,” said
Bob, as the cab drew up in front of the
brownstone building between the home-rushing
roar of Broadway and the
early evening glitter of Fifth Avenue.
“But I’ll tell you what I’m going to do:
I’ll cut away early and see you before
bedtime. I know some girls who keep
bachelor’s hall in a Harlem flat, but
they used to live in boarding houses,
and I’ll telephone them for a list of addresses
and bring it around to you.”</p>

<p>The door of the evangelical shelter
swung open before me. I am not a
timid person, but a chill crept up my
backbone. There was something depressing
in the air of prim rectitude
that pervaded the hall. But Bob was
gone, and my bag&mdash;by the way, it had
looked old-fashioned and shabby beside
his in the cab&mdash;stood within the portals.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I should have expected
the woman at the desk to beam
upon me, or to have a brass band ready
with a pæan announcing that Ellen Berwick
had come to town to conquer fortune.
But her politeness was so impersonal,
her civility so thinly cloaked
her <i>ennui</i>, that I had difficulty in controlling
the quiver of my lips. How
friendly and dear the Agonquitt station
suddenly seemed, with the neighbors
clustered on the platform with their
little last gifts!</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the lady at the desk&mdash;“Berwick.
Your pastor and Mrs. Hennen
recommended you.” I felt that I
was being weighed for a housemaid’s
position, and the blood tingled behind
my ears, but she went on indifferently:
“Your trunk must be sent to the trunk
room within twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it can’t have reached here yet,”
I murmured.</p>

<p>“Within twenty-four hours from the
time when it does come.” I felt that I
had been guilty of levity.</p>

<p>“I thought,” I faltered, “since this is
only a temporary&mdash;er&mdash;stopping place,
that I wouldn’t entirely unpack&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Within twenty-four hours. You
need not unpack entirely. If it is ever
necessary for you to get anything out
of your trunk while you are here, you
may be admitted to the trunk room.
Jenkins, 44.”</p>

<p>“When is dinner?” My question
trailed between the desk and Jenkins,
the elevator man, who miraculously
preserved an air of jauntiness as he
lounged at the door of his wire cage. I
made up my mind to ask him how he
did it.</p>

<p>“Going on now.” The elevator
slammed upon me, and I was borne
aloft to a room of exquisite order and
freshness. But either I saw double or
there were two white beds, two oak
bureaus, two oak wardrobes, <span class="locked">two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This can’t be my room,” I protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, miss,” declared the maid
to whom I had now been delivered.
“No more single rooms left. A lovely
lady has this one with you. You’ll like
her.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The chambermaid passed lightly over
the question of my desires. The door
closed firmly upon my protests, and I
proceeded to remove the marks of
travel from my clothes and person.</p>

<p>Oh, the Olympian indifference of the
lady at the desk to my plea for a room
by myself! In two seconds it reduced
me from a state of angry protest to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of humble gratitude that I had obtained
any shelter at all. Oh, the big dining
rooms, with the narrow tables, and
women, women, women, packed along
them! Oh, the hum of feminine
voices, the shrill of feminine laughter,
the weariness of feminine faces! Never
shall I forget how dreary my own
sex seemed to me when I had my first
sight of it, massed, unindividualized,
hard working, poor, tired. I was suddenly
appalled at the number of us in
New York&mdash;homeless, laboring, impoverished;
for to dine at the Maggie Lou
was tacit proclamation of all these
things.</p>

<p>The food was excellent&mdash;plain, homely,
plentiful. It was handed dexterously
over one’s shoulders and planted
firmly and noisily on the table. There
was danger in unexpected movements
while the waitresses scurried up and
down the narrow aisles between the
tables, as a young woman opposite me
discovered. She leaned forward at a
critical moment in her discourse to emphasize
the statement that “the fleece-lined
cotton were quite as warm as the
woolen”; and she jarred the waitress’
busy arm by her vivacity, receiving a
stream of yellow squash down her back
as penalty.</p>

<p>At a desk, commanding an excellent
view of both exits from the dining
room, a lady sat with the same somewhat
morose expression of countenance
which I was beginning to believe
the universal New York badge. (Later
I corrected this opinion. It is only the
women doomed to constant dealing with
their sisters in the mass who acquire
it.) This particular woman had the
presumably pleasant task of receiving
the money of the diners. In return she
gave them cards, without which egress
would have been impossible, for other
disillusioned persons guarded the doors,
and only the surrender of the oily piece
of pasteboard enabled one to escape.
During the whole period of my incarceration&mdash;I
was about to say&mdash;in the
Margaret Louisa I used to linger about
the dining room hoping that some day
some reckless, abandoned soul would
attempt to flee without the delivery of
her card. But it never happened.
Meekly, automatically, we all paid, received
the token of payment, and
slipped out into the wide halls.</p>

<p>The parlor was a most inviting room,
mellow in tint, comfortable in the cut
of the chairs and sofas, and inviting
with magazines and pictures. I wandered
into it after my first dinner in
New York. I turned the pages of the
magazines, I looked at the pictures on
the walls, and I wondered with all my
powers of bewilderment why every other
woman who entered the apartment
should immediately sit stiffly down,
clasp her hands in her lap or against
her stomach, and gaze at me reprovingly.
As the number of these women
grew, I became convicted in my mind
of indecorous conduct, though I was
only turning the pages of the <i>North
American Review</i>. The rustle of the
leaves sounded noisy, blatant even, in
the ominous stillness. Suddenly I understood
why.</p>

<p>A stout lady in widow’s weeds
cleared her throat twice, warningly, and
the after-dinner prayer meeting was
upon us. The <i>North American Review</i>
slid from my guilty fingers, and
I almost lost my balance as I stooped
to recover the magazine. Then I composed
my features, folded my own
hands and listened to the leader of the
meeting. Once I raised my eyes, and
through the door that led into the hall
I saw Bob Mathews standing. He was
staring into the parlor with an expression
of arrested protest and strangled
mirth upon his nice, homely face. At
that precise moment the worthy leader
was besieging the throne of grace with
intercessions for “the one new come
among us,” and I felt vulgarly prominent.</p>

<p>It did not last long, that prayer meeting,
and when it was over there was a
little gentle conversation. The leader
had just advanced to me with a smile
of professional kindness when Bob bore
down upon me. She withdrew, disapproval
squaring her shoulders. My unfortunate
caller and I retired to the
remotest corner of the room and conversed
in guilty whispers, alternated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with sudden trumpet blasts of sound as
we realized that our subdued manner
was unnecessary and open to suspicion.
All the others sat around and looked at
us. They were all quite sure, I think,
that the list of boarding houses with
which Bob furnished me on departing
was a document of very sinister import.</p>

<p>The next morning, armed with this
list and with one furnished by the uninterested
lady at the office, I set out in
search of a permanent abode. In
Agonquitt I had seemed to myself a
person of the furthest reaching prudence
because I had left for New York
a whole fortnight earlier than my engagement
as Mr. Hennen’s stenographer
required. The two weeks were
to be devoted to “settling comfortably”
and to “learning the city thoroughly.”
By the end of the first forenoon I asked
myself bitterly if a year&mdash;if a lifetime&mdash;would
suffice for either of these results.</p>

<p>I had told six landladies that the hall
bedroom I sought was for myself alone,
and I had been banished at once, without
further parley, from their presences.
I was discouraged to learn that spinsterhood,
which we in Agonquitt regard
as a state normal, admirable and even
a little high-minded, was frowned upon
here. The number of front doors that
closed upon me because I could lay
claim to no husband!</p>

<p>I have never satisfactorily solved the
problem of the average landlady’s dislike
for the single woman. Is the married
boarder less addicted to bathroom
laundry work? Does she consume less
gas in the front hall and the parlor? Is
she not so apt to keep the wearied purveyor
of her meals and lodgings from
the folding bed which adorns the front
drawing room with a pretense of being
a curio cabinet during the day? Or is
it merely that even in these strenuous
days of wage-earning women, a husband
seems to the mediæval-minded
landlady a guarantee of payment securer
than any number of salaried positions?
I don’t know. I only know that
my first forenoon’s search for a habitation
was rendered uncommonly difficult
because I could not assure six gimleteyed
landladies in rusty black that I was
“wooed an’ married an’ all.”</p>

<p>There were other ladies&mdash;a considerable
number of them, too&mdash;who gave
one look at my cloth turban, made by
Miss Milly, our Agonquitt milliner;
and at my reefer, which Miss Keziah,
who goes out by the day, had helped
mother to make; and smilingly shook
their heads. These informed me, interposing
their plump persons between me
and their stairways, as though they
feared a forcible entrance on my part,
that they had nothing which would
suit me&mdash;nothing under twenty dollars
a week. At first this abashed me, for
ten dollars was the utmost which I
could allow for lodgings and meals; and
I departed, gurgling apologetically in
my throat. Later, anger began to stir
my pulses, and I gave these haughty
ones level glance of scorn for level
glance of scorn, and said: “Ah, I am
looking for a suite of two rooms and
bath; breakfast upstairs, of course;
you have nothing of that sort?” And
we separated in mutual incredulity and
respect.</p>

<p>During that day and the soul-racking,
foot-blistering days that followed, I
gained a fairly clear idea of what I
might hope for in a boarding house
for the small sum which I was prepared
to spend. The cheaper places
were, of course, the least attractive; the
halls seemed dingier, the odor of
dreary, bygone dinners more pervasive
in them; the servants were more slatternly,
the landladies themselves more
rusty, dusty and depressing. There
were innumerable parlors furnished in
upholstery that made up in accumulated
dust and aroma for what it had
lost in freshness of color during the
years of its service; there were folding
beds of every sort; there were lace
curtains, and there were pier glasses between
the long front windows. Then,
somewhere up on the top floor, there
was a hall bedroom without a closet,
without heat; but “the last lady”&mdash;marvelously
adaptable female!&mdash;had
always found the hooks under the cambric
curtain on the door an ample refuge
for her gowns, and as for the temperature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
she had been compelled to
keep her window open during most of
the winter before, so intense was the
heat from the hall. She had moved, apparently,
in search of a harder spiritual
discipline than she could obtain
among such comfortable surroundings.
Certainly there was no other reason for
her leaving.</p>

<p>Sometimes, departing from the lists
furnished me, I stumbled upon wonderful
places where “cozy corners” greatly
prevailed, and where the landladies
wore trailing negligées of soiled pink or
blue instead of the tight-fitting black
uniform of the other houses. Whenever
such a meeting inadvertently occurred,
the gorgeous landlady and I
were always as eager as civility would
permit to see the last of each other.</p>

<p>Then there were other places&mdash;airy,
clean and bright, with parlors guiltless
of any suggestion of the folding bed,
with graceful furnishings, efficient servants,
cheerful landladies. But these
were always either “full”&mdash;I don’t wonder&mdash;or
what they had left was far beyond
my humble means.</p>

<p>I wandered through the unhomelike
splendors of the woman’s hotel, by and
by. Here at least there would be no
question of boarding house parlor etiquette&mdash;there
were successions of
charming, big, airy, handsomely fitted-out
parlors; there were tea rooms,
there were libraries and writing rooms.
The bedrooms themselves&mdash;simple, sunny,
clean&mdash;- were charming, with their
chintz-frilled cots and their substantially
made wooden pieces. Here I could
live, by a pretty rigid system of economy,
for nine dollars a week&mdash;four for
my tiny bedroom, five for my breakfasts
and dinners. I would have to share the
sparkling white and nickel bathroom
with only two others.</p>

<p>I was not one of those haughty souls
who revolted at the rule forbidding
masculine callers above the parlor
floors; in the first place, I had not been
long enough in New York to know that
young women ever did receive callers
save in drawing rooms of some description,
and in the second, I didn’t expect
any callers for a long time. Once Robert
Matthews saw me safely settled, I
knew that his neighborly kindness
would dwindle; and he was my only
possible visitor at present. No, one
might be very comfortable at the
woman’s hotel, I was sure&mdash;if one
could overcome a prejudice against being
one of a mass. I had been long
enough at the Margaret Louisa to
know that I abhorred whatever savored
of an institution, and all women in bulk,
so to speak. Even a dingy hall room in
a dreary boarding house, with the
fumes of old dinners wrought into the
very web of the carpets, and a lackadaisically
suspicious landlady, seemed
better and more homelike to me than
the comforts and luxuries of a big feminized
institution. At least, in the boarding
house, one could be an individual,
something more than a number.</p>

<p>However, though I had made up my
mind to the boarding house, I did not
come to it. And that was because of
the unwelcome other occupant of the
room at the Margaret Louisa. She had
proved to be a wholesome, graceful,
rather tall woman of thirty-three or so.
She had none of my rustic air of sullen
doubt when she met strangers. She
was polite, uninquisitive, even uninterested.
Her attitude was the perfection
of civil indifference; she would have
been an ideal woman to occupy the opposite
section on a transcontinental
train, or the other berth in a transatlantic
stateroom, for she was perfectly
considerate, unfamiliar and impersonal.
She told me that she had just come
from a summer abroad&mdash;she was a
teacher of some handicraft in a trade
school for girls&mdash;and that she was staying
at the Margaret Louisa until “the
doctor was through redecorating the
house.”</p>

<p>“Of course everyone makes fun of
the Maggie Lou,” she said, “but I find
it an admirable refuge. It is in the
center of the town; it’s clean, cheap
and respectable; it charges a fair price
for the accommodations it offers, so
that there’s no taint of philanthropy
about it&mdash;though sometimes the managers
seem to forget that. One doesn’t
come here for society. Once one knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
its little red-tape rules, and how to keep
them from interfering with one’s personal
liberty, it’s a very comfortable
place.”</p>

<p>It developed that a woman physician
of Miss Putnam’s acquaintance had a
small house on West Eleventh Street,
the upper floors of which she let to
women lodgers.</p>

<p>“Of course she knows us all,” said
Miss Putnam. “It’s really very convenient.
There aren’t more than six of
us; we are absolutely independent,
without being brutally isolated. Dr.
Lyons serves us all with breakfast in
our rooms, and leaves us to solve the
luncheon-dinner problem for ourselves.
It’s a charming, old-fashioned house,
and she has furnished it in character.”</p>

<p>I sighed bitterly. Dr. Lyons’ six
lodgers paid her five dollars and a half
a week for their rooms and their simple
breakfasts&mdash;as little as I should have to
pay at the huge caravansary which I
was even then considering&mdash;and they
had a home! I could have wept over
the inequalities of life.</p>

<p>Later I wept in very truth. Robert
had sent me a note inviting me to a
glee-club concert. I had accepted the
invitation. Then I had rubbed my aching
body with witch hazel&mdash;it’s no small
athletic feat to climb to the top of twenty-seven
New York houses in one day&mdash;and
I had lain down to rest. A little
before seven I bethought me of clothes.
The black silk which mother had made
for me, with its pretty chemisette and
cuffs of real Val and Indian mull, and
my black net hat with white roses, lay
in the trunk in the trunk room. I made
up my mind to swallow a hasty dinner,
invade the cellar and carry my
poor little finery upstairs after dinner,
so as to be ready for Bob at eight. At
seven-fifteen, having eaten all that I
could in the banging, crowded, steaming
dining room, I approached the office
and made known my wish to go to
the trunk room.</p>

<p>“Trunk room closes at seven,”
snapped the waitress of destiny.</p>

<p>Nor could any tale of my needs, any
indignation concerning the high-handed
retention of my property, move her
from that statement. I went to my
room and wept with rage. Bob impressed
me nowadays as a stylish youth.
How would he like taking me to a musicale
in a short black skirt, a reefer and
that dumpy turban?</p>

<p>Upon my fit of pettishness in came
Miss Putnam. She was politely absorbed
in her own chiffonier for a while.
Then she turned to me with a comical
air of balancing the fear of intrusiveness
against a friendly desire to help.</p>

<p>“Is it&mdash;can I do anything for you?”
she asked finally.</p>

<p>“You can tell that wretched martinet
downstairs what I think of her, if you
have sufficient command of language,”
I rejoined, wiping my eyes furiously.
Then I told her my tale of woe. She
laughed. Then she hesitated and
blushed.</p>

<p>“I’m just home from Paris, as I told
you,” she said. “I’m not going out tonight.
And I knew the Margaret
Louisa well enough to unpack for an
emergency. We’re about of a height&mdash;would
you think me desperately impertinent
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And she actually offered to lend me
some clothes. And I&mdash;I, Ellen Berwick,
of Agonquitt, where all borrowing is
regarded as criminally unthrifty, and
where the borrowing of finery would
seem degenerately frivolous as well&mdash;I
went to that musicale at the Waldorf
in an absolute confection of heavy black
lace over white silk, and a hat all
white tulle and roses and jet! Robert
whistled rudely as he saw me.</p>

<p>“Is this the way they do things in
Agonquitt now?” he asked.</p>

<p>And from something I overheard him
saying to a lovely young matron-patroness
in a peach-colored crêpe, I
gathered that he had somewhat apologetically
prepared her to be kind to a
nice little rustic from his old home.
Thus clothes, as adornments and not
merely coverings, made their first distinct
appeal to me; it was the voice of
New York, if I had only known it.</p>

<p>I blessed Theresa Putnam that evening,
but how much more did I bless her
when toward the end of the fortnight
she burst into our joint abode with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
something less than her usual calm of
manner, and cried:</p>

<p>“Clorinda Dorset isn’t coming back to
the Medical School this year. Do you
want to meet Dr. Lyons? For if you
do, and you like her and she likes
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I did not let her finish.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that there’s a chance
for me in the Eleventh Street house?”
I demanded. I had been to seven boarding
houses in furthest Harlem that day
and had heard seven boarding house
keepers declare that the time from One
Hundred and Eighteenth Street to Wall
was twenty minutes!</p>

<p>By the next morning my trunk had
been rescued from the cave of the
trunks, and stood, unstrapped and unlocked,
in my sloping-roofed, attic
room in the old-fashioned house of Dr.
Lyons. The sunlight poured in through
two dormer windows. There were dimity
curtains at them. There was a blue-and-white,
hit-or-miss rag rug on the
floor. There was a fireplace; there
were old-fashioned chairs that might
have come out of an Agonquitt attic;
there was a plain table, with blotters on
it and bookshelves above; there was a
cot covered with an old homespun blue-and-white
cover. There were potted
geraniums and primroses on the wide
window shelves. I sat down and fairly
rocked in my delight.</p>

<p>“An attic!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I
didn’t believe there was one in all New
York. And a rag carpet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the language of jubilation failed.</p>

<p>Well, my fortnight of grace was
ended. I was housed, by a kindly miracle
and no skill of my own, comfortably,
charmingly, not expensively. I
was a lucky young woman!</p>

<p>I polished my boots to the highest
pitch of brilliancy, I set my stock on
at the most accurate angle, and I proceeded
to Mr. George Hennen’s office
to gladden his heart with the information
that I had arrived.</p>

<p>He received me with some embarrassment&mdash;a
good-looking, slender, boyish
man with an inattentive manner.</p>

<p>“I had meant to write,” he murmured.
“Really, it has been unpardonable. But
I didn’t know until last week, and&mdash;it
is really unpardonable.”</p>

<p>A cold chill gripped me. Was I not
to have the position, after all? I sat
very rigid, my fingers frozen in their
stiff calfskin gloves.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mr. Hennen?” I asked.
“Please tell me quickly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it can be arranged.
I had meant to ask you to defer coming
until the first of December. Miss
O’Dowd’s wedding has been postponed
until Christmas. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Returning waves of warmth lapped
me. After all, I was not to go penniless
and positionless back to Agonquitt.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all?” I cried, in relief.
“I think I can put in the two months to
excellent advantage, Mr. Hennen.”</p>

<p>“Do you, really?” He brightened.
“Are you&mdash;er&mdash;prepared&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” I said, stiffly, though the
emergency fund on my chest no longer
seemed the oppressive weight it once
had.</p>

<p>“If not&mdash;&mdash;” he floundered, evidently
groping with some idea for my relief.</p>

<p>I felt the color tingle in my cheeks.
My mother’s hatred of “Letitia Bland’s”
favors seemed to stiffen my neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am,” I declared. Then
the door opened simultaneously with a
rap. From the Axminster and rosewood
splendors of the outer office a
man entered&mdash;tall, broad, lithe. His
eyes, even in that first flash of them
upon me, I knew to be gay, and his
smooth-shaven lips had lines of laughter
about them. He glanced at me
with a momentary pause in his entrance.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, George. Ferritt said
you were alone.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. Don’t go, Archie. I
want you to meet Miss Berwick. Miss
Berwick, Mr. Charter&mdash;the other member
of the firm. Miss Berwick’s going
to take Miss O’Dowd’s place, you remember,
Archie?”</p>

<p>“Very much more than that, I think,”
said Mr. Charter, smiling. And though
there was something in the cool appraisal
of his manner, in the implied familiar
compliment and criticism of his
words, which made me flush with displeasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
yet when I met his mirthful,
amused regard, I could not but smile in
answer.</p>

<p>There was a little more talk, and I
went out, leaving my address with Mr.
Hennen. There was an agreeable sense
of buoyancy and exhilaration in the air.
I could not fix my mind upon the
gloomy fact that I was to be without
employment and without salary for two
months; I was only very sure that I
should like the work in the office of
Hennen &amp; Charter, when I was admitted
to it. Meantime, I had a hazy
recollection of all sorts of tempting
advertisements which I had seen in the
papers, asking for the services of just
such able-bodied, well-educated young
women as myself. To be an adventurer
in industry for two months might be
amusing; it might be profitable. And
at the end of it there was the office of
Hennen &amp; Charter glowing like a comfortable
beacon for me.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for my peace of
mind that I could not forecast the future,
and had no premonition of my
initial experience as a laboring person.
I was profoundly convinced of my ability
to “take care of myself”; I had a
high respect for my own judgment. Had
anyone suggested to me that my arrogant
self-confidence would nearly land
me in court and almost cover me with
notoriety, I should have dismissed the
suggestion with a laugh.</p>

THE MOTOR<br />

</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/ii.png" width="124" height="122" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi">IN order to understand
this story there are a
few points of information
concerning
“Lonesome Huckleberries”
with which
you ought to be acquainted.
First, his
nationality: Captain Jonadab Wixon
used to say that Lonesome was “a little
of everything, like a picked-up dinner;
principally Eyetalian and Portygee, I
cal’late, with a streak of Gay Head Injun.”
Second, his name: To quote
from the captain again, “His reel
name’s long enough to touch bottom
in the ship channel at high tide, so folks
nater’lly got to callin’ him ‘Huckleberries,’
’cause he peddles them kind of
fruit in summer. Then he mopes round
so, with nary a smile on his face, that it
seemed jest right to tack on the ‘Lonesome.’
So ‘Lonesome Huckleberries’
he’s been for the past ten year.” Add
to these items the fact that he lived in
a patchwork shanty on the end of a
sandspit six miles from Wellmouth
Port, that he was deaf and dumb, that
he drove a liver-colored, balky mare that
no one but himself and his daughter
“Becky” could handle, that he had a
fondness for bad rum, and a wicked
temper that had twice landed him in
the village lockup, and you have a fair
idea of the personality of Lonesome
Huckleberries. And, oh, yes! his decoy
ducks. He was a great gunner
alongshore, and owned a flock of live
decoys for which he had refused bids
as high as fifteen dollars each. There,
now I think you are in position to
appreciate the yarn that Mr. Barzilla
Wingate told me as we sat in the
“Lovers’ Nest,” the summerhouse on
the bluff by the Old Home House, and
watched the <i>Greased Lightning</i>, Peter
Brown’s smart little motor launch,
swinging at her moorings below.</p>

<p>“Them Todds,” observed Barzilla,
“had got on my nerves. ’Twas Peter’s
ad that brought ’em down here. You
see, ’twas ’long toward the end of the
season at the Old Home House, and
Brown had been advertisin’ in the New
York and Boston papers to ‘bag the leftovers,’
as he called it. Besides the reg’lar
hogwash about the ‘breath of old
ocean’ and the ‘simple, cleanly livin’ of
the bygone days we dream about,’ there
was some new froth concernin’ huntin’
and fishin’. You’d think the wild
geese roosted on the flagpole nights,
and the bluefish clogged up the bay so’s
you could walk on their back fins without
wettin’ your feet&mdash;that is, if you
wore rubbers and trod light.</p>

<p>“‘There!’ says Peter T., wavin’ the
advertisement and crowin’ gladsome;
‘they’ll take to that like your temp’rance
aunt to brandy coughdrops. We’ll have
to put up barbed wire to keep ’em off.’</p>

<p>“‘Humph!’ grunts Cap’n Jonadab.
‘Anybody but a born fool’ll know there
ain’t any shootin’ down here this time
of year.’</p>

<p>“Peter looked at him sorrowful.
‘Pop,’ says he, ‘did you ever hear that
Solomon answered a summer hotel ad?
This ain’t a Chautauqua, this is the Old
Home House, and its motto is: “There’s
a new sucker born every minute, and
there’s twenty-four hours in a day.”
You set back and count the clock ticks.’</p>

<p>“Well, that’s ’bout all we had to do.
We got boarders enough from that
ridic’lous advertisement to fill every
spare room we had, includin’ Jonadab’s
and mine. Me and the cap’n had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
bunk in the barn loft; but there was
some satisfaction in that&mdash;it give us an
excuse to git away from the ‘sports’ in
the smokin’ room.</p>

<p>“The Todds was part of the haul.
He was a little, dried-up man, single,
and a minister. Nigh’s I could find out,
he’d given up preachin’ by the request
of the doctor and his last congregation.
He had a notion that he was a mighty
hunter afore the Lord, like Nimrod in
the Bible, and he’d come to the Old
Home to bag a few gross of geese and
ducks.</p>

<p>“His sister was an old maid, and
slim, neither of which failin’s was
from ch’ice, I cal’late. She wore eyeglasses
and a veil to ‘preserve her complexion,’
and her idee seemed to be that
native Cape Codders lived in trees and
et cocoanuts. She called ’em barbarians,
utter barbarians.’ Whenever she
piped ‘James!’ her brother had to drop
everything and report on deck. She
was skipper of the Todd craft.</p>

<p>“Well, them Todds was what Peter
T. called ‘the limit, and a chip or two
over.’ The other would-be gunners and
fishermen were satisfied to slam shot
after sandpeeps, or hook a stray sculpin
or a hake. But t’wa’n’t so with brother
James Todd and sister Clarissa. ‘Ducks’
it was in the advertisin’, and nothin’ <i>but</i>
ducks they wanted. Clarissa, she commenced
to hint middlin’ p’inted concernin’
fraud.</p>

<p>“Fin’lly we lost patience, and Peter
T., he said they’d got to be quieted
somehow, or he’d do some shootin’ on
his own hook; said too much Toddy
was givin’ him the ‘D.T.’s.’ Then I
suggested takin’ ’em down the beach
somewheres on the chance of seein’ a
stray coot or loon or somethin’&mdash;<i>anything</i>
that could be shot at. Jonadab
and Peter agreed ’twas a good plan, and
we matched to see who’d be guide. And
I got stuck, of course; my luck again.</p>

<p>“So the next mornin’ we started, me
and the Reverend James and Clarissa,
in the <i>Greased Lightnin’</i>. Fust part of
the trip that Todd man done nothin’
but ask questions about the launch; I
had to show him how to start it and
steer it, and the land knows what all.
Clarissa set around doin’ the heavy
contemptuous and turnin’ up her nose
at creation gin’rally. It must have its
drawbacks, this roostin’ so fur above
the common flock; seems to me I’d
be thinkin’ all the time of the bump
that was due me if I got shoved off
the perch.</p>

<p>“Well, by and by Lonesome Huckleberries’
shanty hove in sight, and I was
glad to see it, although I had to answer
a million more questions about Lonesome
and his history. When we struck
the beach, Clarissa, she took her paint
box and umbrella and moskeeter ’intment,
and the rest of her cargo, and
went off by herself to ‘sketch.’ She was
great on ’sketchin’,’ and the way she’d
use up good paint and spile nice clean
paper was a sinful waste. Afore she
went, she give me three fathom of sailin’
orders concernin’ takin’ care of
‘James.’ You’d think he was about four
year old; made me feel like a hired
nuss.</p>

<p>“Well, James and me went perusin’
up and down that beach in the blazin’
sun lookin’ for somethin’ to shoot. We
went ’way beyond Lonesome’s shanty,
but there wa’n’t nobody to home. Lonesome
himself, it turned out afterward,
was up to the village with his horse and
wagon, and his daughter Becky was
over in the woods on the mainland berryin’.
Todd was a cheerful talker, but
limited. His favorite remark was: ‘Oh,
I say, my deah man.’ That’s what he
kept callin’ me, ‘my deah man.’ Now,
my name ain’t exactly a Claude de
Montmorency for prettiness, but ‘Barzilla’ ’ll
fetch <i>me</i> alongside a good deal
quicker’n ‘my deah man,’ I’ll tell you
that.</p>

<p>“We frogged it up and down all the
forenoon, but didn’t git a shot at nothin’
but one stray ‘squawk’ that had come
over from the Cedar Swamp. I told
James ’twas a canvasback, and he
blazed away at it, but missed it by three
fathom, as might have been expected.</p>

<p>“Fin’lly my game leg&mdash;rheumatiz,
you understand&mdash;begun to give out. So
I flops down in the shade of a sand bank
to rest, and the reverend goes pokin’ off
by himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>“I cal’late I must have fell asleep,
for when I looked at my watch it was
close to one o’clock, and time for us to
be gittin’ back to the port. I got up
and stretched and took an observation,
but further’n Clarissa’s umbrella on the
skyline, I didn’t see anything stirrin’.
Brother James wa’n’t visible, but I
jedged he was within hailin’ distance.
You can’t see very fur on that point,
there’s too many sand hills and hummocks.</p>

<p>“I started over toward the <i>Greased
Lightnin’</i>. I’d gone a little ways, and
was down in a gully between two big
hummocks, when ‘Bang! bang!’ goes
both barrels of a shotgun, and that Todd
critter busts out hollerin’ like all possessed.</p>

<p>“‘Hooray!’ he squeals, in that
squeaky voice of his. ‘Hooray! I’ve got
’em! I’ve got ’em!’</p>

<p>“Thinks I, ‘What in the nation does
that lunatic cal’late he’s shot?’ And I
left my own gun layin’ where ’twas and
piled up over the edge of that sand
bank like a cat over a fence. And then
I see a sight.</p>

<p>“There was James, hoppin’ up and
down in the beach grass, squealin’ like
a Guinea hen with a sore throat, and
wavin’ his gun with one wing&mdash;arm, I
mean&mdash;and there in front of him, in the
foam at the edge of the surf, was two
ducks as dead as Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;two
of Lonesome Huckleberries’ best decoy
ducks&mdash;ducks he’d tamed and trained,
and thought more of than anything else
in this world&mdash;except rum, maybe&mdash;and
the rest of the flock was diggin’ up the
beach for home as if they’d been telegraphed
for, and squawkin’ ‘Fire!’ and
‘Bloody murder!’</p>

<p>“Well, my mind was in a kind of
various state, as you might say, for a
minute. ’Course, I’d known about Lonesome’s
ownin’ them decoys&mdash;told Todd
about ’em, too&mdash;but I hadn’t seen ’em
nowhere alongshore, and I sort of cal’lated
they was locked up in Lonesome’s
hen house, that bein’ his usual way
when he went to town. I s’pose likely
they’d been feedin’ among the beach
grass somewheres out of sight, but I
don’t know for sartin to this day. And
I didn’t stop to reason it out then,
neither. As Scriptur’ or George Washin’ton
or somebody says, ‘’twas a condition,
not a theory,’ I was afoul of.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got ’em!’ hollers Todd, grinnin’
till I thought he’d swaller his own
ears. ‘I shot ’em all myself!’</p>

<p>“‘You everlastin’&mdash;&mdash;’ I begun, but I
didn’t git any further. There was a
rattlin’ noise behind me, and I turned,
to see Lonesome Huckleberries himself,
settin’ on the seat of his old truck
wagon and glarin’ over the hammer
head of that balky mare of his straight
at brother Todd and the dead decoys.</p>

<p>“For a minute there was a kind of
tableau, like them they have at church
fairs&mdash;all four of us, includin’ the mare,
keepin’ still, like we was frozen. But
’twas only for a minute. Then it turned
into the liveliest movin’ picture that
ever <i>I</i> see. Lonesome couldn’t swear&mdash;bein’
a dummy&mdash;but if ever a man
got profane with his eyes, he did right
then. Next thing I knew he tossed
both hands into the air, clawed two
handfuls out of the atmosphere, reached
down into the cart, grabbed a pitchfork
and piled out of that wagon and
after Todd. There was murder comin’
and I could see it.</p>

<p>“‘Run, you loon!’ I hollers, desp’rate.</p>

<p>“James didn’t wait for any advice.
He didn’t know what he’d done, I cal’late,
but he jedged ’twas his move. He
dropped his gun and putted down the
shore like a wild man, with Lonesome
after him. I tried to foller, but my
rheumatiz was too big a handicap; all
I could do was yell.</p>

<p>“You never’d have picked out Todd
for a sprinter&mdash;not to look at him, you
wouldn’t&mdash;but if he didn’t beat the record
for his class jest then I’ll eat my
sou’wester. He fairly flew, but Lonesome
split tacks with him every time,
and kept to wind’ard, into the bargain.
Where they went out sight amongst
the sand hills ’twas anybody’s race.</p>

<p>“I was scart. I knew what Lonesome’s
temper was, ’specially when it
had been iled with some Wellmouth
Port no-license rum. He’d been took
up once for ha’f killin’ some boys that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
tormented him, and I figgered if he got
within’ pitchfork distance of the Todd
critter he’d make him the leakiest divine
that ever picked a text. I commenced
to hobble back after my gun. It looked
bad to me.</p>

<p>“But I’d forgot sister Clarissa. ’Fore
I’d limped fur I heard her callin’ to
me.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Wingate,’ says she, ’git in here
at once.’</p>

<p>“There she was, settin’ on the seat of
Lonesome’s wagon, holdin’ the reins
and as cool as a white frost in October.</p>

<p>“‘Git in at once,’ says she. I jedged
’twas good advice, and took it.</p>

<p>“‘Proceed,’ says she to the mare. ‘Git
dap!’ says I, and we started. When
we rounded the sand hill we see the race
in the distance. Lonesome had gained
a p’int or two, and Todd wa’n’t more’n
four pitchforks in the lead.</p>

<p>“‘Make for the launch!’ I whooped,
between my hands.</p>

<p>“The parson heard me and come
about and broke for the shore. The
<i>Greased Lightnin’</i> had swung out about
the length of her anchor rope, and the
water wa’n’t deep. Todd splashed in
to his waist and climbed aboard. He
cut the rodin’ jest as Lonesome reached
tide mark. James, he sees it’s a close
call, and he shins back to the engine,
reachin’ it exactly at the time when the
gent with the pitchfork laid hands on
the rail. Then the parson throws over
the switch&mdash;I’d shown him how, you
remember&mdash;and gives the startin’ wheel
a full turn.</p>

<p>“Well, you know the <i>Greased Lightnin’</i>?
She don’t linger to say farewell,
not any to speak of, she don’t. And
this time she jumped like the cat that
lit on the hot stove. Lonesome, bein’
balanced with his knees on the rail,
pitches headfust into the cockpit. Todd,
jumpin’ out of his way, falls overboard
backward. Next thing anybody knew,
the launch was scootin’ for blue water
like a streak of what she was named
for, and the huntin’ chaplain was churnin’
up foam like a mill wheel.</p>

<p>“I yelled more orders than second
mate on a coaster. Todd bubbled and
bellered. Lonesome hung on to the rail
of the cockpit and let his hair stand up
to grow. Nobody was cool but Clarissa,
and she was an iceberg. She had
her good p’ints, that old maid did, drat
her!</p>

<p>“‘James,’ she calls, ‘git out of that
water this minute and come here! This
instant, mind!’</p>

<p>“James minded. He paddled ashore
and hopped, drippin’ like a dishcloth,
alongside the truck wagon.</p>

<p>“‘Git in!’ orders Skipper Clarissa.
He done it. ‘Now,’ says the lady, passin’
the reins over to me, ‘drive us home,
Mr. Wingate, before that intoxicated
lunatic can catch us.’</p>

<p>“It seemed about the only thing to
do. I knew ’twas no use explainin’ to
Lonesome for an hour or more yit, even
if you can talk finger signs, which part
of my college trainin’ has been neglected.
’Twas murder he wanted at the
present time. I had some sort of a
foggy notion that I’d drive along, pick
up the guns and then git the Todds
over to the hotel, afterward comin’
back to git the launch and pay damages
to Huckleberries. I cal’lated he’d be
more reasonable by that time.</p>

<p>“But the mare had made other arrangements.
When I slapped her with
the end of the reins she took the bit in
her teeth and commenced to gallop. I
hollered ‘Whoa!’ and ‘Heave to!’ and
‘Belay!’ and everything else I could
think of, but she never took in a reef.
We bumped over hummocks and ridges,
and every time we done it we spilled
somethin’ out of that wagon. Fust
’twas a lot of huckleberry pails, then a
basket of groceries and such, then a tin
pan with some potatoes in it, then a jug
done up in a blanket. We was heavin’
cargo overboard like a leaky ship in a
typhoon. Out of the tail of my eye I
see Lonesome, well out to sea, headin’
the <i>Greased Lightnin’</i> for the beach.</p>

<p>“Clarissa put in the time soothin’
James, who had a serious case of the
scart-to-deaths, and callin’ me an ‘utter
barbarian’ for drivin’ so fast. Lucky
for all hands, she had to hold on tight
to keep from bein’ jounced out, ’long
with the rest of movables, so she
couldn’t take the reins. As for me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
wa’n’t payin’ much attention to her&mdash;’twas
the ‘Cut-Through’ that was disturbin’
<i>my</i> mind.</p>

<p>“When you drive down to Lonesome
P’int you have to ford the ‘Cut-Through.’
It’s a strip of water between
the bay and the ocean, and ’tain’t
very wide nor deep at low tide. But
the tide was comin’ in now, and, more’n
that, the mare wa’n’t headed for the
ford. She was cuttin’ cross-lots on her
own hook, and wouldn’t answer the
helm.</p>

<p>“Well, we struck that ‘Cut-Through’
about a hundred yards east of the ford,
and in two shakes we was hub deep in
salt water. ’Fore the Todds could do
anything but holler the wagon was
afloat and the mare was all but swimmin’.
But she kept right on. Bless
her, you <i>couldn’t</i> stop her!</p>

<p>“We crossed the first channel and
come out on a flat where ’twasn’t more’n
two foot deep then. I commenced to
feel better. There was another channel
ahead of us, but I figured we’d navigate
that same as we had the first one.
And then the most outrageous thing
happened.</p>

<p>“If you’ll b’lieve it, that pesky mare
balked and wouldn’t stir another step.</p>

<p>“And there we was! I punched and
kicked and hollered, but all that stubborn
horse would do was lay her ears
back flat, and snarl up her lip, and look
round at us, much as to say: ‘Now,
then, you land sharks, I’ve got you between
wind and water!’ And I swan to
man if it didn’t look like she had!</p>

<p>“‘Drive on!’ says Clarissa, pretty
average vinegary. ‘Haven’t you made
trouble enough for us already, you
dreadful man? Drive on!’</p>

<p>“Hadn’t <i>I</i> made trouble enough!
What do you think of that?</p>

<p>“‘You want to drown us!’ says Miss
Todd, continuin’ her chatty remarks.
‘I see it all! It’s a plot between you
and that murderer. I give you warnin’;
if we reach the hotel, my brother
and I will commence suit for damages.’</p>

<p>“My temper’s fairly long-sufferin’,
but ’twas ravelin’ some by this time.</p>

<p>“‘Commence suit!’ I says. ‘I don’t
care <i>what</i> you commence, if you’ll commence
to keep quiet now!’ And then
I give her a few p’ints as to what her
brother had done, heavin’ in some personal
flatteries every once in a while for
good measure.</p>

<p>“I’d about got to thirdly when
James give a screech and p’inted. And,
by time! if there wa’n’t Lonesome in
the launch, headed right for us, and
comin’ a-b’ilin’! He’d run her along
abreast of the beach and turned in at
the upper end of the ‘Cut-Through.’</p>

<p>“You never in your life heard such a
row as there was in that wagon. Clarissa
and me yellin’ to Lonesome to keep
off&mdash;forgittin’ that he was stone deef
and dumb&mdash;and James vowin’ that he
was goin’ to be slaughtered in cold
blood. And the <i>Greased Lightnin’</i>
p’inted jest so she’d split that cart
amidships, and comin’&mdash;well, you know
how she can go.</p>

<p>“She never budged until she was
within ten foot of the flat, and then,
jest as I was commencin’ the third line
of ‘Now I lay me,’ she sheered off and
went past in a wide curve, with Lonesome
steerin’ with one hand and shakin’
his pitchfork at Todd with t’other. And
<i>such</i> faces as he made up! They’d have
got him hung in any court in the world.</p>

<p>“He run up the ‘Cut-Through’ a little
ways, and then come about, and
back he comes again, never slackin’
speed a mite, and runnin’ close to the
shoal as he could shave, and all the time
goin’ through the bloodiest kind of pantomimes.
And past he goes, to wheel
’round and commence all over again.</p>

<p>“Thinks I, ‘Why don’t he ease up and
lay us aboard? He’s got all the weapons
there is. Is he scart?’</p>

<p>“And then it come to me&mdash;the reason
why. <i>He didn’t know how to stop
her.</i> He could steer fust rate, bein’
used to sailboats, but an electric auto
launch was a new deal for him, and he
didn’t understand her works. And he
dastn’t run her aground at the speed
she was makin’; ’twould have finished
her and, more’n likely, him, too.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose there ever was another
mess jest like it afore or sence.
Here was us, stranded with a horse we
couldn’t make go, bein’ chased by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
feller who was run away with in a boat
he couldn’t stop!</p>

<p>“Jest as I’d about give up hope, I
heard somebody callin’ from the beach
behind us. I turned, and there was
Becky Huckleberries, Lonesome’s
daughter. She had the dead decoys by
the legs in one hand.</p>

<p>“‘Hi!’ says she.</p>

<p>“‘Hi!’ says I. ‘How do you git this
giraffe of yours under way?’</p>

<p>She held up the decoys.</p>

<p>“‘Who kill-a dem ducks?’ says she.</p>

<p>“I p’inted to the reverend. ‘He did,’
says I. And then I cal’late I must have
had one of them things they call an
inspiration. ‘And he’s willin’ to pay for
’em,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Pay thirty-five dolla?’ says she.</p>

<p>“‘You bet!’ says I.</p>

<p>“But I’d forgot Clarissa. She rose
up in that waterlogged cart like a
Statue of Liberty. ‘Never!’ says she.
‘We will never submit to such extortion.
We’ll drown fust!’</p>

<p>“Becky heard her. She didn’t look disapp’inted
nor nothin’. Jest turned and
begun to walk up the beach. ‘<i>All</i> right,’
says she; <i>goo’</i>-by.’</p>

<p>“The Todds stood it for a jiffy. Then
James give in. ‘I’ll pay it!’ he hollers.
‘I’ll pay it!’</p>

<p>“Even then Becky didn’t smile. She
jest came about again and walked back
to the shore. Then she took up that tin
pan and one of the potaters we’d
jounced out of the cart.</p>

<p>“‘Hi, Rosa!’ she hollers. That mare
turned her head and looked. And, for
the first time sence she hove anchor on
that flat, the critter unfurled her ears
and histed ’em to the masthead.</p>

<p>“‘Hi, Rosa!’ says Becky again, and
begun to pound the pan with the potater.
And I give you my word that
that mare started up, turned the wagon
around nice as could be, and begun to
swim ashore. When we got jest where
the critter’s legs touched bottom, Becky
remarks: ‘Whoa!’</p>

<p>“‘Here!’ I yells, ‘what did you do
that for?’</p>

<p>“‘Pay thirty-five dolla <i>now</i>,’ says
she. She was bus’ness, that girl.</p>

<p>“Todd got his wallet from under
hatches and counted out the thirty-five,
keepin’ one eye on Lonesome, who was
swoopin’ up and down in the launch
lookin’ as if he wanted to cut in, but
dastn’t. I tied the bills to my jackknife,
to give ’em weight, and tossed the
whole thing ashore. Becky, she counted
the cash and stowed it away in her
apron pocket.</p>

<p>“‘<i>All</i> right,’ says she. ‘Hi, Rosa!’
The potater and pan performance begun
again, and Rosa picked up her
hoofs and dragged us to dry land. And
it sartinly felt good to the feet.</p>

<p>“‘Say,’ I says, ‘Becky, it’s none of
my affairs, as I know of, but is that
the way you usually start that horse of
yours?’</p>

<p>“She said it was. And Rosa et the
potater.</p>

<p>“Well, then Becky asked me how to
stop the launch, and I told her. She
made a lot of finger signs to Lonesome,
and inside of five minutes the <i>Greased
Lightnin’</i> was anchored in front of us.
Old man Huckleberries was still hankerin’
to interview Todd with the pitchfork,
but Becky settled that all right.
She jumped in front of him, and her
eyes snapped and her feet stamped
and her fingers flew. And ’twould have
done you good to see her dad shrivel up
and git humble. I always had thought
that a woman wasn’t much good as a
boss of the roost unless she could use
her tongue, but Becky showed me my
mistake. Well, it’s live and l’arn.</p>

<p>“Then Miss Huckleberries turned to
us and smiled.</p>

<p>“‘<i>All</i> right,’ says she; ‘<i>goo’</i>-by.’</p>

<p>“Them Todds took the train for the
city next mornin’. I drove ’em to the
depot. James was kind of glum, but
Clarissa talked for two. Her opinion
of the Cape and Capers, ’specially me,
was decided. The final blast was jest as
she was climbin’ the car steps.</p>

<p>“‘Of all the barbarians,’ says she;
‘utter, uncouth, murderin’ barbarians
in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She stopped, thinkin’ for a word, I
s’pose. I didn’t feel that I could improve
on Becky Huckleberries’ conversation
much, so I says:</p>

<p>“‘<i>All</i> right! <i>Goo’</i>-by!’”</p>

<p class="drop-capw">MRS. Gueste looked
out from the pink
shade of her parasol
at the cool green curl
of the breakers down
the beach with an actual
frown between
her fine brows. Her
eyes were full of queries. Her delicate
thumb and forefinger nipped a note. It
was from her favorite brother. It had
been brought to her that morning half
an hour after hers had been sent apprising
him of her arrival in Santa Barbara.
It ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lil</span>: Great to have you here. Awfully
sorry can’t lunch. Another engagement
can’t break. See you afternoon.</p>

<p class="p0 sigright">
<span class="smcap">Wallie.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>That <i>was</i> a note to have from one’s
favorite brother, her frown said, as she
turned to her friend.</p>

<p>“But if her family is so good&mdash;&mdash;” she
began, taking up the conversation where
they had dropped it. The sentence
seemed connected in her mind with the
note, at which she looked.</p>

<p>“Oh, but they can’t manage her,” replied
Julia Crosby, punching her parasol
tip into the sand. “Mr. Remi died
when Blanche was a baby. Mrs. Remi
is a nervous invalid. Blanche has run
wild since she could run at all. If she
were a boy&mdash;well, she’d be the ‘black
sheep.’”</p>

<p>“Is she <i>fast</i>?” said Lillian Gueste,
with horrified emphasis.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>no</i>!” Mrs. Crosby hastened.
But she seemed to find it difficult to explain
to her friend just what Blanche
Remi was. “She’s&mdash;well, she’s wild.
She does such things&mdash;things none of
the other girls do. She drives a sulky.
She rides in a man’s coat and red
gloves. It sounds so silly when you tell
it,” she ended, feeling she had failed to
properly impress her friend, “but you
can always see her coming a mile away,
whether it’s golf or a garden party.”</p>

<p>“You mean she’s a tomboy?” said
Mrs. Gueste, doubtfully. Her smile said
that Walter would never take that sort
seriously.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it were <i>only</i> that!” Mrs.
Crosby’s gesture was eloquent. “Do
you know what they call her here?”</p>

<p>“They?”</p>

<p>“Well, everybody. Some man, I
think, started it. They call her ‘the
Wrecker.’”</p>

<p>“The Wrecker?” Mrs. Gueste’s inquiring
eyes were on her friend.</p>

<p>“Because every man in Santa Barbara,”
Julia Crosby went on, “has at
one time or another&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Run after her? Oh!” Disgust was
in the last little word. Mrs. Gueste
understood it all in a moment. “She’s
<i>that</i> sort. Is she pretty?”</p>

<p>“Stunning! Overwhelming!” said
Mrs. Crosby, generously. She herself
was little and indefinite.</p>

<p>“M-m-m! So poor Wallie is overwhelmed?”
Lillian mused. “Julie, why
didn’t you let me know sooner?”</p>

<p>“But, my dear girl, it was all so
vague! Even now I don’t know that
there’s anything&mdash;but there was getting
to be such talk!”</p>

<p>“But you think he’s serious?” Mrs.
Gueste’s smile was deprecating.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That’s why I telegraphed.
I knew <i>you</i> would.” Her
eyes roved anxiously down the beach,
and suddenly fixed. “There they are
now,” she said, with a small, sharp excitement.</p>

<p>Lillian Gueste started, peered under
her pink parasol. Some dozen rods distant
the plaza and the beach below it
fluttered with the moving colors of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
crowd. Between the plaza and the bath
houses lay an empty space of beach,
and down that glittering white perspective
came a horse with a light sulky.
They could make out two people in it:
a man, holding on his hat; a woman
bareheaded, driving&mdash;driving so that
one wheel of the sulky spun the foam
of the receding water. The man was
Wallie&mdash;Wallie laughing, hugely enjoying
it.</p>

<p>Still at a little distance the sulky
stopped; the driver gave the reins to
her escort, and sprang out with the
light, certain leap of a cat. An indifferent
Englishman, who had noticed
nothing before, put his glass in his eye
and stared. It may be he had never
seen anything so tawny, so glistening,
so magnificent, as the undulant masses
of hair gathered up on the crown of the
girl’s head. A long tan-colored ulster,
the collar turned up around her throat,
fell to her feet. She stood pulling off
a pair of red gloves, looking up and
laughing to Walter Carter, who got out
with his habitual lazy lurch.</p>

<p>The two were near the narrow plank
that led from the women’s bath houses.
Bathers were coming out in bathrobes,
which, five steps from the door, they left
hanging on the rope, while they hopped,
high-shouldered and shivering, down
the beach. The girl kicked off her tennis
shoes and handed them to Walter,
stripped off her ulster, and stood out in
a scarlet bathing dress that, covering
the knees, left bare legs, slim, brown
and dimpled as a child’s. She lingered
across the interval of dry sand,
calling over her shoulder to Walter
something that left him a-grin with
amusement; then went joyously down
the dip of the beach for the rush of
the incoming breakers, and launched
into it with the swash of a little, launching
ship. The lawlessness of it was
beyond any words Lillian knew.</p>

<p>“You see, she does things like that,”
Mrs. Crosby explained in her friend’s
ear.</p>

<p>“Oh, impossible!” Lillian murmured,
watching Blanche Remi’s bathing dress
glimmer through the green breakers.
“Do you suppose Wallie is going in,
too?” she added, glancing down the
beach.</p>

<p>The young man was sauntering toward
them, unconscious of his sister’s
scrutiny, his steps directed, probably,
toward the men’s bath houses on the
left of where the two women sat. He
was as lankly dawdling as ever, but
Lillian noted, with a vague uneasiness,
his usual air of agreeable <i>ennui</i> was
supplanted by one of half-wakened interest.
The remnant of a smile was on
his habitually serious face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gueste stood up and motioned
with her lorgnon. He saw, stared,
smiled broadly, delightedly, and hastened
toward her.</p>

<p>“I say,” he said, subsiding between
them, “this <i>is</i> luck! But why didn’t
you let a chap know you were coming
a few hours before you landed? What
started you, anyway? I thought you
had planned for Castle Crag.”</p>

<p>Julia Crosby’s telegram was hot in
Lillian’s pocket, and she thought, anxiously,
that Julia’s face was conscious
enough to give the thing away. But
Walter was frankly unsuspicious.</p>

<p>“If I’d known just a day ahead,” he
reproached her, “I could have lunched
with you as well as not.”</p>

<p>“But your engagement?” Lillian
hinted.</p>

<p>“Oh, to bring Miss Remi down for a
dip. I was going up for you while she
paddled ’round, but now I’ve got you
here, too, I won’t have to budge.”</p>

<p>Little as she liked the idea of being
thus lumped with Blanche Remi, Lillian
made it a point to be lovely.</p>

<p>“Miss Remi?” she wondered, sweetly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Didn’t you see us?”
He was just a little conscious. “There
she is at the raft,” he added. “You
must meet her, Lil; mustn’t she, Mrs.
Crosby? There’s no one in Santa Barbara
like her.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Mrs. Gueste looked
through her lorgnon at the glinting
speck traveling out on the water.</p>

<p>Wallie frowned. He hated his sister’s
lorgnon, and her lorgnon manner
was his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bête noir</i>.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shan’t be able to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
until Miss&mdash;er”&mdash;she searched for the
name&mdash;“comes out. We must be at the
house by three.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I’ll signal her
to come back. Where’s something?”
His hand fell on his sister’s parasol,
and before she could protest he had it
at the edge of the beach, waving over
his head. It was probably the first
conspicuous performance of that very
discreet parasol; and as for the punctilious
Wallie&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he gets that sort of
thing from her?” Lillian articulated.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Mrs. Crosby agreed,
faintly. She felt a wish to escape being
present at the approaching introduction.
“If you don’t mind, Lily,” she excused
herself, “I really ought to run uptown
and see Mrs. Herrick for a few
moments. You remember I promised
her.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Wallie will see me
home.” Lillian smiled, remembering
how in their school days Julia’s conscience
had always precipitated the
crisis, and dodged the consequences.</p>

<p>She sat composedly alone in the sand,
watching the glinting speck drawing
landward. Wallie stood awaiting it, his
toes in the water, his sister’s pink parasol
held like a saber in his hand.</p>

<p>As the girl came splashing through
the shallow flow, dripping, glowing,
shaking the drops from her hair, Mrs.
Gueste saw she carried a little dog, a
terrier, in her arms, and this seemed to
put the last touch to her conspicuousness.
She came up the beach talking,
gesticulating vividly, to Walter. Once
she nodded to a loose-lipped, pleasant-eyed
man who passed them, but she did
not give Mrs. Gueste a glance until she
was fairly before her&mdash;until Walter
spoke his sister’s name. Then, when
she gave suddenly the full glow of her
face, and the strength and light of her
hot, hazel eyes, she was, as Mrs. Crosby
had said, overwhelming. The touch of
her damp hand to Mrs. Gueste’s delicate
glove was the touch of compelling
physical magnetism that could be looked
at safely only through a lorgnon.</p>

<p>But not the lorgnon, nor its accompanying
manner, disconcerted Miss
Remi. Her own manner was easy,
without freeness.</p>

<p>“You <i>do</i> look like your brother, Mrs.
Gueste,” she said, seating herself in
the sand, and warning the wet terrier
away with upraised finger.</p>

<p>“Flattered, Lillian?” Wallie murmured,
with cloaked satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re very nice looking, Wallie,”
Blanche Remi told him, with a
frank, smiling, up-and-down glance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gueste’s lorgnon rose sharply to
this sentence, but her voice was gentle.</p>

<p>“Don’t you find it rather cold going
in this morning?” she asked.</p>

<p>The girl’s faint change of expression
appreciated the round turn that had
been given the conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s always pretty cold, but I
keep moving, so I keep warm,” she said.
There was a glint of mischief in her
wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>“But don’t you feel cold while you’re
out?” Mrs. Gueste persisted.</p>

<p>The girl, sitting unwinking, unfrowning,
in the glare, looked like some luxurious
creature sunning itself. A faint,
fine powdering of freckles gave even
her skin a tawny hue. Even down the
throat, where Lillian was milk white,
she showed a tint like old ivory, with
creamy shadows under the square chin.
She looked up at Lillian Gueste’s face in
the dainty shadow of her parasol.</p>

<p>“Do I <i>look</i> cold?” she laughed. “You
must let me show you how to keep
warm. Do you swim? Oh, you should!
It saves your nine lives. You ride, of
course?”</p>

<p>“If I can find a horse that suits me.”
Mrs. Gueste’s soft reply suggested she
was hard to suit.</p>

<p>“You must try my Swallow. She’s
perfect. We must have a saddle party,
mustn’t we, Wallie?” the girl appealed
to him. “But first you may take me to
call on Mrs. Gueste. I know she’ll
have too many engagements to risk calling
on her hit-or-miss.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gueste’s reply was a murmur,
as she rose, shaking out her soft linen
skirts.</p>

<p>Walter Carter felt indefinitely uncomfortable.
Blanche Remi stood beside
his sister, slightly taller, more vigorously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
more carelessly, more brilliantly
made. She looked rather commanding,
as if she were used to having things
her own way; which was precisely what
Lillian, little as she looked it, was used
to having. But now her manner toward
Blanche was almost appealing.</p>

<p>“I am going to beg your escort away
from you, Miss Remi, if you will permit
it, just to drive me back to Mrs. Crosby’s.
I haven’t seen him for three
months, you know.” Her voice and
eyes somehow made three months seem
interminable.</p>

<p>Blanche did not show by the flicker
of an eyelash that she appreciated the
cleverness of this maneuver. “Why,
that’s a dreadful loss of time for Wallie,”
she said.</p>

<p>He thanked her with a glance that
made his sister wince.</p>

<p>“Then shall I come back for you&mdash;Blanche?”
The name came out after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Blair Hemming will drive
me back.”</p>

<p>Lillian felt a vague resentment that
the girl should be so sure.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget about to-morrow,”
Blanche warned Wallie, bidding good-by,
and left him wondering what had
been to-morrow. Nothing had, but the
words, as Blanche had wickedly foreseen,
lingered in Mrs. Gueste’s mind,
and vexed her.</p>

<p>“You have so many engagements, I
wonder whether I shall see you at all,”
she hinted, as he handed her into the
runabout.</p>

<p>He flushed slightly. “Well,” he said,
genially, as he took the reins, “you
know there are mighty few of ’em I
wouldn’t break for you, Lil.”</p>

<p>As they spun down the spongy
asphalt of the boulevard, between the
palms and electric-light poles, she was
asking herself why it was that good, unsuspecting
fellows like Wallie were always
pounced upon by such women.
She felt it was horrid to meddle, but this
creature was so astonishingly impossible,
and yet so overwhelming, that Wallie
could hardly be expected to rescue
himself. But she was cautious.</p>

<p>“Did you meet Miss Remi here, Wallie?”
she asked him.</p>

<p>“Yes, at something at the country
club.”</p>

<p>“Does she go <i>there</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. All the nice people
go there.” He looked at her in
lazy surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, with a falling inflection.
It was discouraging to find him
so unconscious. “Does she go much?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere. She’s awfully popular.
How does she strike you?” He
tried to be casual.</p>

<p>“She’s not like anyone else I’ve seen
in Santa Barbara,” Lillian replied.</p>

<p>He fairly glowed. She had never
seen Wallie so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“You’re just right, Lil! There <i>is</i> no
one like her. She makes every other
girl look like a dough doll! It’s not
only that she’s beautiful&mdash;she isn’t
afraid of anything, she don’t care how
she looks&mdash;she’s just crackling with
life.”</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> admire her so awfully?”
Lillian said, with such an amazed emphasis
on the personal pronoun as
brought him up short.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;of course. Why not?
Don’t you?” The color came up under
his brown skin.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, slowly, “of course
I’ve only met her once; but really, Wallie,
is she quite&mdash;fine?”</p>

<p>“Fine? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>She knew that he knew what she
meant. The word was not a new one
from her. It was her measure, her
ruler by which she judged the world.
He was not so unconscious, then, as he
seemed.</p>

<p>“I mean what you’ve been so accustomed
to in women, you dear, that you
don’t know they can lack it,” she said,
caressingly. “Is she <i>nice</i>? <i>Is</i> she a
lady?”</p>

<p>Something threatening looked out of
her brother’s eyes. “Well, I introduced
her to you.”</p>

<p>“I know. You put me in rather a
difficult position, Wallie.”</p>

<p>“See here, Lil”&mdash;he dragged out his
words with slow emphasis&mdash;“I don’t
know who you’ve been listening to, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
you can take it from me that’s she as
fine as silk and as good as gold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to her goodness, I haven’t a
doubt, of course.” She seemed to set
this aside as a trifle. “But as to fineness,
now, Wallie, what do you think of
a girl driving through town in her bathing
suit, with a man, and jumping out
of her coat and shoes on the beach before
everyone, as she did? She did it to
make a sensation; and do you think
<i>that</i> fine, Wallie?”</p>

<p>He flushed, but laughed.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. It was a whim&mdash;a freak.
She thought nothing at all of any effect
on the beach. That’s the trouble;
she thinks too little of the effect, and
so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so she wears no stockings&mdash;and
so she’s called ‘the Wrecker,’” his sister
added, with inconsequent effect.</p>

<p>His face was grave, even disturbed.
“Oh, yes, I’ve heard <i>that</i>. But she’s
so beautiful, so happy, you can’t wonder
at the attraction; and you know
there’s always gossip. And then she’s
run wild. She has had no one to take
care of her&mdash;&mdash;” he left the sentence
hanging.</p>

<p>His sister inwardly shivered. When
a man talked about “taking care” in that
tone, she seemed to see the end.</p>

<p>They were winding up the wide, wandering
Main Street, the rose-covered
verandas of the Arlington on their left;
on the right an old garden ran back to
the white stucco fronts and red tiles of
the De la Gera place.</p>

<p>“Wallie,” Lillian asked him, softly,
“<i>are</i> you in love with that girl?”</p>

<p>“Me! Oh, what a question, Lil!”
He laughed at her&mdash;his nice, lazy laugh
she loved so much.</p>

<p>“Are you, Wallie?”</p>

<p>He put up his monocle to meet her
lorgnon. “My dear girl, <i>do</i> I look pale
and sunken?”</p>

<p>“You are dodging the question. But
think”&mdash;she was light, almost playful,
over it&mdash;“is she the sort of woman you
would care to introduce as your&mdash;wife?”</p>

<p>Wallie looked a little startled, but he
took her tone. “My dear Lil, I haven’t
thought of her in quite that way.” He
grew more serious. “I think she’s wonderful.
I never saw anyone like her.
You must know her better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can,” Lillian
sighed.</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t <i>see</i> her?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must, since you are going
to bring her to call. But I won’t
go about with her. I can’t. Couldn’t
you see there on the beach&mdash;she isn’t
our kind?”</p>

<p>“She looks nothing like you, certainly,
Lillian,” he replied, coolly, “if you
insist on judging people by appearances,
but it’s hardly a ‘fine’ way to judge.”</p>

<p>“Now, Wallie&mdash;&mdash;” they had turned
into the Crosby drive, between the rose
of sharon and syringa bushes.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he went on, “you’re always
waving that word around as if it
were the only thing worth being, and
every virtue hung on it. But what
about honor, and generosity, and simplicity,
and courage? Are they nothing
compared to it?”</p>

<p>The runabout had stopped before the
piazza steps, but Lillian sat still a moment,
frowning faintly.</p>

<p>“When I said ‘fine,’” she answered,
“I didn’t mean fine finish, cultivation,
which is a surface thing, but I meant
fine fiber, which goes deep and counts
in every way with everything. One
judges the big things by the small
ones,” she said, as Wallie handed her
out, “and remembering mother, and the
way we were brought up to feel and
understand, I think you will presently
agree with me that Miss Remi is hardly&mdash;fine.”</p>

<p>She gave him a smile with the last
word; and her look, the movement of
her graceful head in the turn, the poise
of her delicate body, the fall of her
delicate dress, showed forth every shade
of meaning which that word could contain.</p>

<p>The memory of her thus was with him
all the afternoon. It buzzed like a bee
in his brain that night through the dinner
at the Crosbys’, though Lillian, ravishing
in daintily blended shades of
chiffon, referred by no suggestion to the
talk of the afternoon. She and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
word, he thought, mutually described
one another. Lillian was fine, and fine
meant Lillian.</p>

<p>Deep down or on the surface, he
knew she was the real thing. And the
inevitable, following question was, what
was Blanche Remi? She was the real
thing, too. He was sure of that. Lil
was ’way off, he told himself, when she
said the big things showed up in the
little. He had been bothered all his life
by the petty goodnesses of women, and
now that he had found one who had the
great goodness he was not going to be
disturbed by Lil’s scruples. As for being
“in love” with Blanche Remi&mdash;Lillian
had put it to him as he had never
put it to himself.</p>

<p>From the first night her marvelous
eyes had flashed into his indolent notice,
he had felt an inclination to exterminate
every other man who talked
to her. And there were <i>so</i> many. The
supposition on the tongues of Santa
Barbara that all these men made love to
her he had not believed&mdash;could not
have tolerated. Why he had not made
love to her himself was not from lack
of impulse, but something in the very
greatness of the emotions and passions
she roused in him, something in her fine,
free ignorance of the trifles that make
up the virtue of most women, had made
any trifling with her impossible to him.
But he felt himself brought down to
facts. What was he finally intending
toward this girl whom he never saw
without wanting to kiss, to carry off?
His wife?</p>

<p>Well, Lil was right. Blanche did lack
the superficial polish. Strange he hadn’t
noticed that before. But that was just
the use of Lil. She could be a lot of
help if she could only be made to like
Blanche, and, of course, all that was
necessary was that Lil should know her
better. He would, he decided, take
Blanche to call there to-morrow.</p>

<p>With a little telephoning this was arranged,
and Wallie had it all made out
just how beautifully he would direct
that interview and carry it through.
But the direction was reversed at the beginning
by so small an incident as a
woman’s hat. Not that the hat was, in
itself, so slight an affair. Indeed, when
Blanche came out to where he waited
her, curbing the most impatient horse in
Santa Barbara, the hat was the first
thing he saw.</p>

<p>It was wide. It was hung about
with lace&mdash;too much lace. It was covered
with pink roses&mdash;too many roses.
Walter did not quite know what to
think of it, but he had a feeling that
Lillian would.</p>

<p>As Blanche sprang into the cart with
that vigorous, energetic lift of her body
in which the muscles seemed always
tense with action:</p>

<p>“Where’s that little white, flyaway
thing you used to wear?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know&mdash;this is a new
one. Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a little&mdash;large for driving?”</p>

<p>She flushed but smiled. “Not for
calling. Now, Wallie, that’s the first
time since you met me that you’ve noticed
my clothes. I don’t believe
you’ve known whether I’ve had any.
Is it because you’ve been having ideals
put under your nose? Is it”&mdash;she
laughed, drawing on a pair of extremely
long lavender gloves&mdash;“because
you are afraid your sister won’t approve
of my hat, any more than she
approved of my legs?”</p>

<p>It was this astonishing freedom of
speech, more than the hat, that made
him uneasy of the approaching interview.
Of course Blanche could say
what she liked to him. He understood.
But the very idea of her talking that
way to Lillian made him shiver.</p>

<p>But Blanche did not talk “that way”
to Lillian. There in the Crosby garden,
where the magnolias dropped languid
petals on the lawn, she was touchingly
like a little girl on her good behavior.
She tried, with her anxious
sweetness, to make Wallie’s sister like
her. But Lillian had seen the hat first,
and got no further. It was to the hat
she talked, and it seemed to Walter
that his sister’s costume, so notably
discreet, somehow set off all the daring
of Blanche Remi’s gown, the telling
blacks of which were touched in
at the most unexpected intervals. Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Lillian, instead of helping, trying to
put Blanche at her worst? He thrust
that thought out of sight as disloyal.
He sat, wretchedly uncomfortable, trying
to remember whether he had ever
seen Lillian wear long lavender gloves,
hearing Lillian deftly turn and dispose
of, unanswered, Blanche Remi’s
suggestions for horseback excursions
and “plunge parties.”</p>

<p>He expected, with every covert
snub, that Blanche would suddenly, diabolically
turn tables on her, as he had
seen her do with other women. But
Blanche, who had always had what she
wanted, now, for perhaps the first time
in her life, wanted a woman to like
her. And it did not occur to her that
she should fail in her desire. But what
had been her strength was now her
failure. Her compelling magnetism
alarmed Lillian Gueste. She had been
thoroughly convinced at first glance
that the girl was “bad form.” But now
she felt her force as something terrible
and threatening to Wallie. The very
sweetness of the smile Blanche gave
her in going seemed too rich.</p>

<p>“But the protection,” Lillian reasoned,
going over the interview afterward
with herself, “is that Wallie is
beginning to see.”</p>

<p>Wallie, bitterly irritated, saw, indeed,
many trifles that he had failed to
see before, perplexing as so many pricks.
Things he had thought amusing in
Blanche Remi&mdash;her red gloves, her
white spats, her man’s hunting coat, the
terrier she took to receptions&mdash;would
they do for Mrs. Walter Carter? Suppose
he should put it to Blanche that
way, would she take it from him? he
wondered. He felt he must put it to her
some way now&mdash;the questions of Mrs.
Walter Carter&mdash;for in the background,
dimly threatening him, was that aggregation,
each one a future possibility&mdash;the
pasts he would not contemplate&mdash;and
all villainously responsible for the
name gossip had fastened upon her,
“the Wrecker.” He knew that Santa
Barbara accounted her a “dangerous”
woman, but to him, even with her fatal
fascination, she had always seemed a
child. And now it came to him that
it was not the help of a woman, but
the protection of a man, Blanche Remi
required most.</p>

<p>He felt he could not wait a day, a
moment, to tell her; but somehow it
was very difficult to find that moment;
his time was so unostentatiously but
so thoroughly permeated and broken
with Lillian’s engagements for him. A
week escaped in which, without having
seen Blanche less, he had seen her under
circumstances that admitted no opportunity.</p>

<p>Lillian had not, as she first threatened,
ignored Blanche. She had invited
her, if not to dine, at least to a beach
tea, to a driving party; had talked with
her at the country club; had kept her
before Wallie, always at arm’s length,
as if to give him ample opportunity for
comparison.</p>

<p>Walter could find no flaw in his sister’s
attitude of disinterested politeness,
of pale cordiality toward Blanche Remi,
but side lights on it now and then
made him suspicious. He was bewildered&mdash;as
bewildered as a man tangled
in a veil. He felt that the first fine intimacy
of his fellowship with Blanche
was dulled. He was distressed with a
sense of being on a more formal footing
with her. At the same time others&mdash;men
who had been very much in the
background&mdash;seemed to come forward
into her notice. He saw her at the
country club dances magnetize the men
too bored to dance into an interested
circle round her. Dismayed, he saw
her first with one, then with another,
driving, swimming, sitting on the beach
under one parasol in the association so
intimate, so informal, that, before Lillian
came, he had usurped to the exclusion
of the many. Finally, out of
the crowd, as the one oftenest with her,
he saw Blair Hemming, the man of
loose lips and good-natured eyes, to
whom Blanche had bowed that morning
on the beach.</p>

<p>Walter had thought him a decent
enough fellow, but now he was suddenly
vile. And Blanche? Her behavior
was unreasonable and unfair.
But perhaps he had let himself drift
too much with Lillian’s plans. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
self-accusing, a little self-righteous, he
rang up the Remis’s to make an appointment
to ride horseback with Blanche
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Her voice reached him, nasal, resonant,
with a vibrant quality that touched
the ear with a fascination deeper than
sweetness. She had a luncheon engagement
at the club.</p>

<p>He was annoyed that he had not
known of this.</p>

<p>“How about to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” came back; “but make
it a foursome. Get your sister to come.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you would rather,” he
answered, a little stiffly. “What <i>has</i>
happened?” he asked himself. He knew
he had done nothing. Was Blanche
changing? Had he only imagined her
attitude toward him differed from her
attitude toward half a dozen others?
It had seemed different&mdash;but how could
a man be sure?</p>

<p>Harassed, suspicious, he hesitated
over making the proposal to Lillian until
the next afternoon at the last moment.
He rode over to the Crosbys’
and found his sister, fair and diaphanous
in her mousseline gown, crumbling
bread to the gold fish in the fountain.
The look she gave his proposition, sweet
as it was, made him uncomfortable.
Any man would do to fill in the fourth
place, he had stupidly said.</p>

<p>“Any man for Miss Remi?” she had
asked him. And he had fired.</p>

<p>She heard him with a half smile,
softly beating the ground with the dried
palm leaf she prettily carried as a parasol.</p>

<p>Well, she told him, she did not care
particularly for such an expedition. It
was such a time since she had seen him
alone! Wouldn’t it be much nicer to
make it just a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> dinner at Estrelda’s?</p>

<p>He replied, with irritation, that if she
did not care to make one of the party,
it would not prevent him from taking
Miss Remi.</p>

<p>“Ah, a previous arrangement,” Lillian
said, taking in his whip and his
riding boots as if she had just noticed
them. “Well, you must realize by this
time just what sort of a person she is.”</p>

<p>“I am far from being sure, but I intend
to find out this afternoon.”</p>

<p>She turned sharply. “You mean you
are going to ask her to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I am?”</p>

<p>“After the way she’s been running
about with this Hemming?”</p>

<p>“Lillian&mdash;look out,” he warned. His
sister’s smile was tight and fine.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she said, with a little
shrug, letting her hands drop in a gesture
that seemed to make an end of the
matter. At the moment her brother
appeared to her no less than a monster.
But she watched him down the drive
with a revulsion of mood. She felt he
was leaving her forever, her Wallie, her
little brother! He was a year younger
than she. She had let her sense of
personal injury get in the way of his
happiness&mdash;and he was going to that
woman.</p>

<p>She stood, the palm leaf fallen from
her hand. He must be stopped, interrupted
somehow. He should not do a
thing in a heat to regret forever. Calling
his name, she hurried down the
drive to the gate, but he had already
turned out of the side street, and was
beyond both sight and call. She fairly
ran across the garden, over lawns and
borders, her gown streaming, regardless
of dust or wet. Had anyone seen
her running, flushed and breathless,
across the piazza and up the stairs, he
would scarcely have recognized, in her
abandon, Mrs. Cornelius Gueste.</p>

<p>She hurried into her habit, trying to
remember whether Wallie had said they
would go down through Monticito and
come back by the beach, or whether it
were just the other way about. Where
could she hope to catch up with them?
It would be a humiliating affair enough
for her; but she was not in the least
thinking of herself, but only of Wallie,
and some way by which she could avert
his catastrophe.</p>

<p>Walter had departed with the responsibility
of what he was about to
do heavily upon him. His sister’s look
had not failed to affect him. He felt
he was adventuring, risking, going to
deal with unknown quantities.</p>

<p>He was to meet Blanche in town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
where she had told him she had some
shopping to do. Halfway down the
wide, wandering Main Street he saw
her mare fastened in front of the confectioner’s.
Riding up, he could glimpse
through the glass door Blanche, a tall
habited figure, strolling here and there,
sampling the sweets. He sat waiting,
scowling in the glare of the afternoon
sun on white awnings and sidewalks.
He saw Hemming jump out of his cart
a few doors down, in front of the saddler’s,
with a broken bridle over, his
arm.</p>

<p>“Hey, Carter!” He came and leaned
on the flank of Walter’s horse, his
hand on the back of the saddle.</p>

<p>“Beastly familiar,” Walter thought.</p>

<p>Hemming’s good-natured, sensual
face was vivid with animal spirits.
“Where were you last night?” he said.
“You <i>did</i> miss it!”</p>

<p>“What?” drawled Walter.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Jack Castra’s dinner dance.
Great!” Hemming’s eyes narrowed.
He shook his head. “I got Blanche
Remi a bid. You know she wanted
one like the devil. Mrs. Jack is a terrible
stickler, but we’re great pals, and
she let me have it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Remi went?” Walter’s voice
was very lazy.</p>

<p>“Did she go?” Hemming laughed.
“I’ll tell you what it is,” he said, “the
Wrecker’s a wonder! She’s such a
wonder that most of the women say,
‘Hands off.’ But between you and me,
she makes every other woman look like
a Dutch doll.”</p>

<p>Walter had an impulse to strike Hemming.
His own words had been flung
back at him, but he failed to recognize
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I had a good time,” Hemming
repeated, significantly, but unmalicious.
“So long.” He sauntered into the saddler’s.</p>

<p>Walter watched the confectioner’s
door opening. So Blanche was under
an obligation&mdash;such an obligation&mdash;to
Hemming! He had not thought Hemming
such a bad lot, but now&mdash;&mdash; Things
Lillian had said crowded back
to him. And Blanche’s attitude lately?
The color thickened in his sallow
cheeks.</p>

<p>Blanche came out of the door with
a swing. She was eating a chocolate.
As she stood under the rippling awning,
pulling on her red gloves, he saw she
was glowing with excitement. The
weight of her splendid hair under her
man’s hat, the play of color in her eyes,
the slight backward fling of her figure
as she poised&mdash;each detail proclaimed
eloquently how fully she was a conscious,
vital force, stupendous to reckon
with.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mrs. Gueste?” was the first
question she tossed at him, with a
straight, studying look.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;she had a headache&mdash;and&mdash;er,
another engagement,” he added, lamely.</p>

<p>Blanche laughed. “One would have
been enough,” she said; but the curve
of her lip quivered. She stopped his
reply with a second question.</p>

<p>“Who ran away as I came out?” she
asked, settling in her saddle.</p>

<p>“Blair Hemming.” He looked at her
sharply, but she showed no consciousness;
only a smile, as though Hemming
were something funny.</p>

<p>“Did you have an amusing time last
night?” he asked her.</p>

<p>Some vague reminder of Lillian
Gueste’s voice startled her. The color
deepened in her cheeks. “Oh, lovely!
Hemming”&mdash;she never gave a title to
a name&mdash;“took me to the Castras’.”</p>

<p>“Did he get you the invitation?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“I didn’t <i>ask</i> him for it. He offered
it.”</p>

<p>“But you took it?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Everyone does it.”</p>

<p>Walter looked at her uneasily. He
knew well enough that everyone didn’t.
He said stiffly: “I don’t like the idea
of your being under obligations to a
man like Hemming.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a quick flush.
It might have been anger or pleasure.
But then her lashes lowered over her
eyes to cover the secret.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> don’t!” she said. “And how do
you suppose Hemming likes my being
under obligations to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>He was aghast. “What has <i>he</i> got
to say about it?”</p>

<p>“What have <i>you</i>?” She let it fall
gently.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he burst out. “Do
you lump <i>us</i>? I thought that you and
I were&mdash;were&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Friends?” she filled in without a
quaver. “We were. But you’ve changed,
Wallie.”</p>

<p>“Since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your sister came.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense&mdash;&mdash;” he began,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No”&mdash;her eyes were somber, smoldering&mdash;“she
<i>hates</i> me!” Blanche emphasized
the word with her whip on the
mare’s flank. “She thinks I’m awful!
Hasn’t she said that to <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“She has said nothing of the sort.
She has nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“She has everything!” Blanche said,
suddenly, passionately. She jerked the
mare’s head fiercely.</p>

<p>They had turned out of the dazzling
street into a softly sprinkled side way,
where the pepper trees wept their tassels
in the dust. Blanche kept her eyes
on the bit of blue sky that seemed to
close the end of the street like a jewel
in a setting.</p>

<p>“Before she came you took me for
just what I was. You believed in me,
Walter. But ever since she said things,
I feel&mdash;oh, I don’t know! As if you
were a long way off, watching me, and
wondering about everything I say and
do.”</p>

<p>He broke in: “Because once or twice
I criticised some trifle!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “don’t think I
wouldn’t take criticism from you! I’d
take a lot. I’d even wear the sort of
hats your sister does!”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound the sort of hats! You
know that’s not it. It’s&mdash;I&mdash;love you,
Blanche.”</p>

<p>He brought out the little isolated sentence
breathlessly, with a jerk. His sallow
face was flushed.</p>

<p>Blanche was very pale. The horses
took five steps while there was silence.
Then:</p>

<p>“It’s sweet of you to say that.” The
girl’s voice was shaken. “But you
know, Walter, as <i>she</i> does, I’m not her
kind.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to be!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, Walter?” She looked at
him earnestly. “And I’m not your
kind, either. I mean, I’m not like the
women you’ve known. <i>She’s</i> made me
feel that&mdash;your sister. It’s one reason
why I hate her. Oh, I do!” She
nodded at him. “You may as well know
that. She makes me see what I’ve
missed&mdash;little things I thought didn’t
matter. But now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, child,” he interrupted, exasperated,
manlike, with her self-depreciations,
“those little things don’t count!
It isn’t that. But if you loved me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If I <i>loved</i> you?” She turned large,
astonished eyes on him.</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t take things from
Blair Hemming. I won’t stand it,” he
broke out. “He was talking about you,
Blanche.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference. A woman
can’t afford to be talked about in any
way. She can’t know a man in such
a way.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” The girl was
breathless.</p>

<p>He seemed to see long perspectives
of pasts: the crowds around her at the
dances; the men at dinners, talking to
her across the disapproval of the other
women; the looks following her down
the beach. “Well, you know what I
mean,” he answered, sullenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter!” Her arms fell at her
sides with a gesture of eloquent despair.
She seemed to divine his retrospection.
“But I can’t help it! I don’t do it on
purpose&mdash;though I know people say I
do. <i>You</i> don’t&mdash;don’t think I’m ‘the
Wrecker’?” She aimed the word at
him like a blow, and while he sought an
answer: “You don’t believe me. You
don’t trust me. You’re wondering now
whether I let Hemming make love to
me. Hemming!”&mdash;she leaned toward
him with a savage head shake. “I may
not know a good hat when I see one, but
I know a good man!”</p>

<p>The spur pricked. The mare
bounded. She was rods away before
Walter realized he was deserted. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
he followed. The girl turned and motioned
him back.</p>

<p>“Go away, go away!” she cried.
There was something at once so imperious
and so entreating in voice and
gesture that he involuntarily halted, and
she wheeled and spurred on at a gallop.</p>

<p>If she had not ridden so headlong
she must have shrieked. The tempest
in her was too much for expression.
She saw, subconsciously, a gray blur
of olive trees streaming past, with here
and there the richer note of orange
orchards, and always the road before
her, an intense white line over and
around the smooth-topped hills. She
did not slacken pace at the passing
phaëtons, though these may have contained
people whom she knew. She
dared not look behind her, through a
stifling hope and doubt that Walter had
followed. She breasted the last hill
crest, where the road lifts out of the
gardens and orchards of Monticito to
the high, wind-raked bluff above the
sea.</p>

<p>Here she reined in and turned and
looked back down the long, straight
stretch of road she had come. Empty,
far as eye could see. She listened,
breathlessly, but the interminable whisper
of the eucalyptus leaves above her
head was the only sound. And she had
thought so surely he would follow!</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands
and sobbed&mdash;crying like a man, with
deep chest respirations that shook her
whole body. The mare, feeling a relaxed
rein, moved a few steps. The
girl’s hands fell from her face. She
looked seaward through the slim, swaying
eucalyptus trees. The tears rolled
down her cheeks to the corners of her
twitching mouth. Mechanically she
wiped them away with the wrist of her
red glove. It left odd, bloodlike streaks
on her tawny skin. They gave a menacing
look to her despair. She was not
thinking of how she looked, but of
whom she had left, of how she loved
him! She was feeling, with her blind
forsakenness, that if Walter gave her up
she was lost. If he only knew how little
the other people mattered! How
good, how awfully, abjectly good, she
could be if she had him&mdash;the only man
who had never made love to her! She
remembered, with a stir of pure pleasure,
how at first she had been piqued
and puzzled that he did not. Afterward,
how she had loved him for it!
But since this woman, his sister, had
come, Blanche did not know how it had
been brought about, but she knew that
she and Walter, who had been so close,
so understanding, were apart and at
odds. He had trusted her, and now he
suspected her.</p>

<p>She saw Lillian Gueste’s hand in it.
Blanche did not reason; she only felt,
and hated the subtle and delicate treason.
Did Lillian Gueste suppose, she
asked herself, that because a woman
wore large hats and loud gloves she had
no right to the man she loved?</p>

<p>She rode along the cliff edge at a foot
pace, her eyes abstractedly on the dancing
shadows of eucalyptus leaves the
sun painted in the dust. She wondered
was this the close of what had been
opening out before her as her life? She
thought, with her primitive reasoning,
were Lillian only out of the way&mdash;her
mind did not get further than that.
But Blanche had felt from the first that
Lillian Gueste had come to Santa Barbara
for no other reason than rescuing
her brother, and that she did not intend
to go until she took Wallie with her.
“Could she do that?” Blanche wondered
in a panic. Had an opportunity offered,
she would have pushed Lillian Gueste
out of her way as she would have thrust
a pebble from her path.</p>

<p>The sun, falling low in the western
sky, made towers of tree shadows, and
spread an iridescence over the in creeping
fog, as she followed the descending
road downward toward the arroya,
where a bridle path slipped seaward
under willows. She had taken that
path often before. It met the beach
below what was the usual limit for riders,
but she loved the long, exciting gallop,
the scramble among the rocks, the
spice of danger at the narrow turns
about the two points when the tide was
coming in.</p>

<p>The salt smell of the sea met her,
strong with reek of kelp, as she approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
its thunder through the willows.
The range of sea and sky, the
free wind blowing between, gave her
release from thought and scope to act.
The tide was running in high and full.
Where the first bold bluff jutted out, a
distance of some six yards, the sliding
foam already lapped the rock. Once
around the turn of the bluff, the beach
lay before her&mdash;a long white, empty
sweep under black cliffs.</p>

<p>She rode at an easy canter, breathing
in the stinging salt air, looking out
upon the water, where the dark “seaward
line” swung with the swell a mile
out in “the channel.” She had lost the
choking tears, the despair of her first
rush down the Monticito road. She
felt not happy, but wildly at liberty.
The wind took her hat, and she
laughed, seeing it spin down the
beach. The tingling breeze in her
hair whipped out the short, springy
curls. The high animal spirits that had
helped her over situations where a less
vital woman would have been overwhelmed
had begun to reassert themselves
in the exercise and open air. She
scanned the empty beach perspective.
What a gallop to the far point! She
touched the mare, then pulled her up
sharply in the first bound. The beach
was not empty. Some one was riding&mdash;perhaps
a quarter of a mile in front
of her&mdash;imperfectly to be distinguished
among the scattered rocks.</p>

<p>Her first thought was “Walter!”
Trembling with eagerness, she peered
under a sheltering hand. The rider was
a woman. In the revulsion of her feeling,
Blanche’s disappointment was an
inarticulate sound. All her misery was
back upon her. Who it was, riding
slowly down the beach in a direction
similar to her own, did not matter. She
only wanted to avoid being seen&mdash;hatless,
red-eyed, wild&mdash;by this woman,
who, being a woman, was her natural
enemy. She rode slowly, cautiously,
hoping the other would quicken her
pace, and put the next point between
them. The sun had fallen into the fog,
from under which the ocean thundered
sullen, gray, up the shore.</p>

<p>Blanche wanted to get around the
next point before dusk. She saw the
horse in front&mdash;bright sorrel on the yellowish-white
sand&mdash;drawing slowly
near the black shoulder of rock; finally,
fairly at the turn of it. In an instant
it would be out of sight. No, it
had stopped; stood motionless a full
minute; then, to the girl’s intense
amazement, wheeled and came back
down the beach at a quick lope. There
seemed something of vexation in the
sharp turn-about.</p>

<p>Had the woman seen, and come back
to speak with her? Blanche wondered.
There was no avoiding the meeting.
Shaking her hair over her eyes, she
rode forward. As the rider drew
nearer, with a contraction of heart she
recognized Lillian Gueste. At the same
instant she knew that Lillian had not
seen her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gueste’s face wore a preoccupied,
a vexed, a vaguely anxious, look.
The sand half quenched the sound of
the horse’s coming. They were almost
abreast before she saw Blanche Remi,
and then it was with a start, a stare of
keen surprise, of interrogation, that effaced
the first expression.</p>

<p>Blanche knew whom the questioning
eyes missed. There was about them a
subtle, tantalizing suggestion of Walter,
and she felt the blood run in her
temples as she bent her head in faint
recognition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gueste stopped.</p>

<p>“Where is my brother?” she said.
She fairly challenged the other with it.
That she did not name him Mr. Carter
was a mark of her extreme surprise,
alarm; for Blanche Remi, with discolored
eyes, disheveled hair, and the red
stains across her face, looked wild
enough to have thrust a displeasing
lover into the sea.</p>

<p>Blanche looked at and realized how
she hated this woman, this unruffled
perfection. The strength of her feeling
frightened herself. But her voice
was as cool as Mrs. Gueste’s.</p>

<p>“I have no idea,” she said, politely
insolent, and made to go on.</p>

<p>Lillian Gueste’s sharp scrutiny had
taken in all the girl’s misery, and supposed
a scene. Her idea of what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
been Walter’s part in it made her, with
a revulsion of relief, almost amiable.</p>

<p>“You can’t get around that way,” she
said, looking over her shoulder at the
point. The vexation was back on her
face. “The tide is in.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eye ranged back along the
beach. The black cliffs seemed suddenly
to have marched seaward.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t get back <i>that</i> way,”
she said. “The water was up to the
second point when I came through an
hour ago&mdash;it’s over the quicksand.”</p>

<p>“Quicksand?” Lillian looked at her
blankly. “Then what can we do?”</p>

<p>“Get around there,” said Blanche,
waving back to the near point.</p>

<p>“We can’t.” Irritation and unbelief
were in Mrs. Gueste’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve done it before. It’s easy. Come
on.” Blanche was nonchalant in the
face of the encroaching sea. The gulls
were screaming above their heads, the
sound of shattering water was in their
ears, as they rode forward.</p>

<p>At the shoulder of the point the wind
met them, and the inrush of the ocean.
Here the beach sloped suddenly. The
cliffs came out in a convex sweep of
several rods, with a sharp jut of rock
thrust out from the midst of it, like a
fish’s fin. Over it, up to the cliff face,
the water fawned and leaped, and in its
sucking recoil left bare for an instant
a narrow neck of sand.</p>

<p>Blanche looked at the bulging bluff,
the sharp rock. That made it bad. One
could not make a straight dash&mdash;would
have to make an angle&mdash;out and then
back; and a moment’s hesitation at the
turn&mdash;well, it wouldn’t do to meet the
ebb there. Blanche knew the strength
of the undertow.</p>

<p>With her eyes on the rising and receding
water, she made a rapid calculation
for the best moment to go in. She
was excited, eager for the enterprise.
She was surprised at the other woman’s
pallor.</p>

<p>“We can’t get through there,” Lillian
Gueste said, half angrily. She looked
small, pale, impotent, among the severities
of waves and sky.</p>

<p>“Then where?” Blanche slid lightly
from her saddle.</p>

<p>“If we should shout&mdash;&mdash;” Lillian began.</p>

<p>Blanche almost laughed at her. Did
this woman expect to be rescued?
Blanche’s experience had been that people
in bad places had to get themselves
out.</p>

<p>“Up on the cliff you couldn’t hear a
cannon fired down here,” she said.
“We <i>can</i> get through, only you must
not be afraid.” She began loosening
the lower hooks of her habit bodice.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Lillian
asked, nervously. She felt fearful
of what might happen next in these
strange, perilous conditions.</p>

<p>“Take off my skirt. Better do the
same. Then if a wave gets you you
can use your legs.”</p>

<p>Lillian looked at her in horror. “Oh,
no!” she said, feeling somehow insulted.</p>

<p>“It’s dangerous,” said Blanche,
swinging into her saddle man-fashion.
In her boots and spurs, with her wide
shoulders and narrow hips, she looked
a beautiful boy. “You’d better be
astride, anyway,” she said.</p>

<p>“I can keep my saddle.” Lillian’s
mouth twitched nervously. “Shall I go
first?” she said. Blanche saw her hand
on the rein tremble. In her excitement
at the trick of the sea she had merged
her personal attitude toward Lillian.</p>

<p>“No, follow me, and do as I do.
Wait until the wave breaks, and go out
with it. Then when you turn at the
rock you won’t have the ebb against
you. You’ll go up with the flow. It’s
perfectly safe. But you must not hesitate
a minute. When I shout, dash!”</p>

<p>The breakers were coming in high
and quick. The neck of sand next the
cliff was seen only momently. The
nose of rock was perpetually in a boil
of water.</p>

<p>Blanche waited, let the great seventh
wave go by, and in the midst of the
surge of its recoil dashed in. She felt
the mare stagger as the tow took her.
A swift, terrible force seized and
snatched her seaward. She was swept
along like a drift. Then, almost touching
the point of rock, she was relinquished.
With the roar of the next
breaker sounding fairly upon her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
spurred savagely. The mare plunged
with a boil of water to her knees, with
a wake of white behind her. She went
up the beach with the spray of the driving
ocean in her hair. She wheeled and
waved to the woman on the other side.</p>

<p>Through flying foam she could see
Lillian Gueste’s face, a little white, a
little strained in its composure.
Blanche had felt no fear for herself, but
now she had a thrill through her body,
a withering sensation in her throat, to
see Lillian Gueste waiting there, hanging
on her word to make the rush. And
the haunting semblance of Walter in
the fixed <span class="locked">eyes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Don’t look at the water!” Blanche
shouted. “Look at me! Now!” she
screamed, to make herself heard above
the breaking wave. But the horse and
rider hesitated before the recoil of it;
came on, seemed to hover on the brink
of it.</p>

<p>“Go back!” Blanche shouted, with
frantic gesticulation. The ebb was
racing out. Lillian wavered, now fairly
in; then the sorrel floundered out,
belly deep in the surge. Now the girl
saw him close upon the point of rock&mdash;now
suddenly dragged out from it.
A yard of fretted water heaved between.
Blanche sat as if hypnotized,
with the sight of a struggling horse and
rider black etched on the green water.
It rushed over her all at once who it
was the ebb was taking out, and she
was motionless. She saw the rider’s
face turned landward with the stark
stare of the drowning appealing to her
with Walter’s eyes. The next moment
she was in deep water. She breasted
the current with a rush. She saw a
horse, with empty saddle, struggling,
swimming, drifting out; saw a swash of
black tumble in the twisting tides that
sucked it seaward. She made a plunge
and seized a skirt. Her fingers held a
flow of hair. Threshing hands caught
at her stirrup. A body sprang tense
to her lift. Then the sea had them
again.</p>

<p>Eyes, ears, lungs, full of it. Blanche
felt the mare gallantly struggling to
keep footing; the steep sand seemed
slipping away from under them. Then,
with a roar, the dark parted. She
gasped in the air. She saw Lillian’s
face wax white at her knee. She had
not strength to lift more than the head
and shoulders as she trailed the limp
figure up the beach.</p>

<p>Her knees tottered as she slid from
the saddle. Her ears were ringing. Or
was some one, somewhere, really calling
to her? A cart was plunging and
bouncing down the grassy tussocks
that dip from the coast road to the
beach.</p>

<p>“Oh, Blair!” She cried the driver’s
name in a burst of relief.</p>

<p>“That you, Blanche?” He had
jumped out of the cart and was running
toward her. He saw the drenched
figure on the sand.</p>

<p>“My Lord! Mrs. Gueste!”</p>

<p>Blanche’s clutch on his arm hurt
him. “Oh, <i>is</i> she dead?” she entreated
him.</p>

<p>“Not by a good deal.” He gave his
flask to Blanche, and rolled his carriage
robe around Lillian. Then he stripped
off his mackintosh. “Here, girl,” he
said, and Blanche thrust her arms into
the sleeves.</p>

<p>“Saw you down there,” he said, lifting
the unconscious woman’s dead
weight into the cart. His voice was
matter-of-course, but his look said she
was magnificent.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry!” Blanche implored.
“Take her over to the Crosbys’, Blair!
Oh, quick!”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, then. I’ll whirl you
over in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going home&mdash;I’ll ride. I’m
all right,” she said, through chattering
teeth. “But she might&mdash;and Mr.
Carter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, go, go!” She lifted herself
into the saddle. Weak as she was, her
nervous excitement carried her up.</p>

<p>“And mind, Blair, don’t say anything&mdash;if
you love me!” She almost laughed
the last words at him. Then she was
off.</p>

<p>She chose not to take the boulevard,
but cut through the town by lanes and
side streets, where in the dusk of gathering
night and inclosing fog her dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
horse, her drenched habit, would
escape observation. She shook with
nervous excitement, but the fast riding
kept the blood pounding in her veins.
She had no power to think coherently
of what had happened. She had seen
Blair Hemming lift Lillian Gueste into
his cart, but the idea possessed her that
Lillian had gone out in the tide, and
drowned with that terrible face looking
back to land, with Walter’s eyes.</p>

<p>She urged the exhausted horse cruelly
because the face seemed to stare at
her out of the dark street ends. She
seemed to look from the surface of
things into an abyss of possibility. She
felt afraid of herself as something horrible.</p>

<p>But as she turned into the drive between
the ghostly acacias returned the
little, concrete fear lest she be seen by
anyone, most of all her mother. There
were lights in the drawing-room windows
that looked out on the drive oval,
and Blanche cautiously took the far
side, to be screened by the feathery
palms.</p>

<p>Leaving the mare at the stable, and
money in the stableman’s hand, she
stole tiptoe up the side stair. Once in
her room, she stripped, bathed, rubbed
her damp hair dry, tossed it up gleaming
on the crown of her head, and, still
in her glow and shiver of excitement,
hooked herself into a black lace dinner
gown glittering with jet, fastened a
diamond crescent over her bosom, and
swept in upon her mother and maiden
aunt, who were patiently, resignedly,
dining without the belated equestrienne.</p>

<p>“Why, darling!” her mother murmured,
in gratified amazement. Blanche
seldom bothered to dress for dinner,
and to-night she seemed almost too dazzling
to be real. She was surprised
herself at the extent to which her
bravado covered what had happened.
Inwardly she was quaking. Her ears
were alert for every sound.</p>

<p>“Did you have a nice time?” her
mother asked her.</p>

<p>“Oh, lovely!” said Blanche, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>“Where did you go?”</p>

<p>“Down the beach.” Blanche started.
Her hand poised halfway to an olive.
She heard what her ears had been pricking
for&mdash;horses’ feet on the gravel
drive.</p>

<p>With an effort she held herself quiet.</p>

<p>The Spanish maid opened the dining-room
door. “Some one to see you,
señora.”</p>

<p>Blanche, who had half risen, sank
back in her chair.</p>

<p>“Why, who can it be?” Mrs. Remi
was murmuring as she went into the
hall.</p>

<p>Blanche sat listening, lips apart. She
heard her mother exclaim; then a man’s
voice exclaimed; she knew the voice;
she rose. Her heart seemed beating in
her throat. She heard her mother’s
voice, perplexed, emphatic: “But she’s
all right; she’s very well. There’s
<i>some</i> mistake!”</p>

<p>Then Walter Carter’s, insisting: “But
they were both in the water. Hemming
saw her bring Lillian out. He drove
my sister home. How could
Blanche&mdash;&mdash;” When she burst upon
them.</p>

<p>“Walter!” The sight of him, wild-haired,
pale, his mackintosh over his
evening clothes, his general look of catastrophe,
struck her with only one significance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gueste?” she gasped. “How
is she?”</p>

<p>For a moment Walter could only
stare at her, dazed. He had seen his
sister&mdash;drenched, disheveled, white,
unconscious&mdash;carried into the house.
And here stood Blanche, vital, vigorous,
self-possessed, groomed for a function.</p>

<p>“My God, no&mdash;it was you!” he
stammered. “But&mdash;but is there any
mistake?”</p>

<p>The soft sound of the dining-room
door closing left them alone face to
face. He came toward her. She
stepped back.</p>

<p>“There’s no mistake. At least, we
were in the water, and <i>she</i> was afraid.”</p>

<p>“But Hemming said she was washed
out of the saddle&mdash;and the tow took her
out, and you went after her and got
her!” He still came toward her. It
was hard to look him in the face, for
the bewildered eyes reminded her of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Lillian Gueste’s look when the tide took
her out from the rocks. Blanche felt
her bravado running out at her finger
ends.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t&mdash;&mdash; I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Walter,
you don’t know what I did!” She faltered
and sobbed. She leaned against
the hatrack and buried her face in the
folds of a coat.</p>

<p>“Why, child, you simply saved her!”
His arms were around her, and he tried
to pull the cloak from her face. “She
wants to see you to-morrow. She wants
to tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I can’t. She wouldn’t if she
knew&mdash;&mdash;” Blanche’s voice was muffled
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, what?” he muttered, his lips
against her cheek.</p>

<p>The answer reached him, a half
smothered, almost contented whisper:</p>

<p>“How I hated her!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A PERUSAL of the
daily papers would
lead one to the belief
that racing, socially
speaking, had just
been discovered in
New York. No account
whatsoever is
taken by the cheerful metropolitan of
the rest of the country, though racing
is going on from California to Washington,
from Chicago to New Orleans&mdash;indeed,
it is to the South that we go
for both our hunters and our thoroughbreds.
All through the Southern States
there are little sporting communities
hunting a pack of hounds, whose runs,
if they took place in the neighborhood
of New York, would be reported in all
our papers by the <i>society</i>, not the sporting,
editor.</p>

<p>For our thoroughbreds we still go to
Kentucky. It was only the other day
that I heard the owner of one of the
great stock farms there complaining
of the ignorance and extravagance of
one of our younger Northern racing
men, who sent his trainer South to <i>buy</i>,
at any figure that he chose.</p>

<p>Washington, though now more cosmopolitan
than Southern, gives, from
the social standpoint, warm encouragement
to racing. In all our cities now
there seems to be growing up a young
married coterie&mdash;parallel to the fashionable
circle in New York. Such a
characteristic little group is to be found
in Philadelphia, in Chicago, in Baltimore
and in Washington. This coterie,
which is neither of diplomacy nor yet
of old-time Washington, gives special
attention to the Bennings track. Not
but what the younger diplomats are to
be found there, on Saturdays, when they
are able to get away from their embassies
and legations. Miss Roosevelt
is an enthusiastic spectator. Oddly
enough, in contrast to our Northern
tracks, it seems to be permissible for
two girls to go alone together to Bennings
without escort. Maidens of careful
upbringing may be seen stepping
from the trolley at the race track as
coolly as if it were a county fair.</p>

<p>If the New York papers take no account,
socially speaking, of all these
tracks, it is scarcely to be expected that
their memories should go back as far
as Jerome Park. It was a poor course,
I am told, with bad turns and obscure
corners, but prettier to look at than any
we have had since. The lawn in front
of the clubhouse&mdash;which was separated
from the grand stand by the whole
width of the track&mdash;was crowded by
the members of a society smaller but
more complete than Morris Park or
Sheepshead has ever seen.</p>

<p>The opening of Belmont Park is destined,
probably, to make a difference, to
emphasize again the social side of the
sport. The country club on the grounds&mdash;the
club within a club, as it were&mdash;will
draw a different set of people from
those whom a mere jockey club can attract.
It will be used quite independently
of any question of racing by all the
little communities of Long Island. If
Hempstead and Westbury and Roslyn
and Cedarhurst will come there to dine,
and use it as the object of an automobile
trip or a drive, there will be a well-established
social life connected with it
before the next race meeting opens.</p>

<p>I do not believe that any nation derives,
as a whole, quite the delight from
a race track that we do&mdash;with our Puritan
traditions. To the English it is the
national sport; to the French the extravagance
of the smartest people; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to us, though both these elements may
enter in, it is an intense excitement,
which many of us have been brought
up to think wicked. The mere word
“horse-racing” would have struck terror
to the hearts of our grandmothers, and
thus a sport perfectly harmless to most
of us has acquired a most alluring flavor
of naughtiness. It is this feeling, this
common sense of emancipation, that
holds together a race-going crowd with
a general sense of gayety. For as a
nation we are not conspicuous for gayety.
If we do not take our amusements
solemnly, like the English, we at least
take them strenuously. In this respect,
racing has changed a good deal in the
last twenty years. We are a little more
serious about it than we used to be.
In my recollection of the old days at
Jerome Park, the clubhouse&mdash;certainly
the feminine portion of it&mdash;took the
sport itself much more lightly. The
drive out in somebody’s coach, and the
wonderful clothes one could wear and
see, were the most important features
of the day. You did not find the ladies
in the paddock, as you see them now.
Nor did they as openly transfer crisp
bills from their own pretty purses to the
bookies. Mild “pools,” in which one
<i>drew</i> for one’s number quite irrespective
of tips and inside information, were
the only ladylike form of betting. There
was something quite casual and social
in the way in which everybody sat about
on the lawn, under, I verily believe, the
most brilliant parasols that the world
has ever seen; the clubhouse behind us,
and on the side a long line of coaches.
It was a very long line, yet we could
all tell them at a glance.</p>

<p>But this has changed now. Automobiles
have driven out coaches. Not but
what one still sees them, beautifully appointed,
at any track; but instead of being
the chosen means of locomotion for
the fortunate, they are merely a picturesque
way of wasting time. The consequence
is that at Belmont Park one
notices a distinct modification in the
gorgeousness of the women’s clothes.
In this country we have never gone
the lengths of English women, whose
clothes at Ascot and Epsom seemed to
me quite as suitable to a ballroom. Still,
our best dressed women have always
felt hitherto that the races afforded a
unique opportunity&mdash;especially when
approached on the top of a smart coach.
At Jerome and even at Morris Park,
where New York could pour out in electric
hansoms, this was still the rule, but
to Belmont Park the trip in an automobile
over dusty Long Island roads, or
even on the Long Island Railroad, will
not permit the same elaborate dressing.</p>

<p>It is not, however, only the chance to
see and wear good clothes that gives
races their charm to feminine eyes.
Perhaps their chief attraction is the
flavor of the great world. The penalty
of leading a sheltered life is having a
limited outlook, and the obverse of being
select is being narrow. Women are
beginning to see this. Society is unquestionably
growing more and more
friendly to the successful outsider, the
people who are, as the phrase is, “doing
something.” So far literary stars have
had the main share of notice, but great
actresses, great artists, even great scientists,
have nowadays much more attention
paid to them than the merely well-bred
and socially available can hope for.
Even the most exclusive of our great
ladies no longer take pride in never
having heard the name of anyone outside
their own circle. We have not become
such lion hunters as the Londoners,
but we enjoy very much having
pointed out to us, here a great plunger
from Chicago, there a dancer never before
seen but from across the footlights.
The race track is an excellent
field for such experiences. Not, of
course, that these experiences must be
carried too far. It is one thing to see
the celebrities of the stage, but quite another
to hear them calling our husbands
and brothers by their first names. A
recent instance of this kind has been
brought to the attention, so it is said,
of the governors of Belmont Park, with
the result that box holders have been
implored to be more circumspect in
their choice of guests.</p>

<p>But of all our tracks, Saratoga offers
the most amusing phases to the observer
of things social. Smart New York appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
to think that Saratoga ceased to
exist from the time when it was no
longer the Newport of our grandmothers,
until rediscovered in the interests
of racing by the late Mr. William C.
Whitney. The true situation is infinitely
more amusing.</p>

<p>Saratoga, with its enormous hotels,
teeming with a society busy and well
entertained, has been perfectly satisfied
with itself in spite of the fact that
smart New York knew it not. The
United States Hotel has represented all
that was socially delightful to many people
who never heard of the “Four Hundred.”
And now suddenly into this
community comes the smartest of New
York’s racing section&mdash;the Whitneys,
the Mackays, the Wilsons and the
young Vanderbilts, and several more of
like sort. And not only do they come,
but they come under circumstances that
render almost impossible the exclusiveness
that has been regarded as essential.
This year, I believe, the Mackays and
a few others are renting separate
houses, but hitherto it has been hotel
life for everybody. Hotel life, which
New Yorkers so scorn! A “cottage”&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
a suite of connecting rooms in a
great caravansary&mdash;was the utmost seclusion
possible. After the publicity of
the race track, this was the only refuge.
Then to meet the crowd again at dinner
at Canfield’s (the ladies penetrated
no further than the dining room even
in the palmy days), and later, perhaps,
to listen to the band at the Grand
Union. This is a life in contrast to the
seclusion of the cliffs at Newport. Verily
racing makes strange companions.</p>

<p>There is something particularly gay
in the atmosphere of the place. Any
serious business other than racing is
so plainly lacking. As the meeting is
in summer, a great many men choose
their holiday so as to take it in. The
result is that we suddenly find ourselves
in the midst of a class of idle men&mdash;at
leisure and eager to be amused, almost
like a foreign community. No one who
has been to Saratoga will ever repeat
the worn platitude that American men
do not know how to enjoy a holiday.</p>

<p>We must remember, too, that for the
feminine element racing is one of the
few opportunities for&mdash;can we use so
ferocious a term as “gambling” for the
risking of a mild fiver on a “sure
thing”? People are fond of saying that
women are born gamblers; meaning, I
suppose, that they love it better than
men do. But it seems to me that this
is only half the truth. The element of
chance has charms for all of us, and
women have so few opportunities to indulge
it. They do not usually speculate
in Wall Street; their daily occupation
is not a gamble, as so many businesses
are; the private wager is almost unknown
to them. Until bridge swept
over us, women could not, while <i>spending</i>
as much money as they pleased,
have any of the fun of losing it. Perhaps,
in spite of all the talk about the
intellectual stimulation of bridge, it
owes some of its popularity to the same
causes that the races do.</p>

<p>Not but what I believe that the interest
of many women is a truly sporting
one. Feminine love and knowledge of
horses have increased wonderfully in
the last twenty-five years. Our mothers
and grandmothers rode, but took it
as an elegant relaxation, or even as a
mere means of locomotion. In this
country the true sportswoman&mdash;the
woman who hunts and drives four-in-hand
and tandem&mdash;is a fairly recent development.
In England we have only
to go back to the novels of Whyte Melville
to see that even in the middle of
the last century she was a known type.
It is not at all uncommon for women
over there to know quite as much about
horses as their brothers, to understand
the horses and the cattle and the pigs.
For Englishwomen to own a racing
stable is no novelty, while here the joint
experiment of two of our best known
ladies was very much talked about, and
endured but a short time.</p>

<p>The sport is essentially a sport for
men. Women are merely onlookers;
and in so far as it has a social side,
even that side is controlled by men,
serving thus as the great exception to
things social.</p>

<p>Naturally we assume that the majority
of men who go into racing go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
it for the love of the sport itself. Yet
we cannot look about us and see the
men who have not only no knowledge
of racing, but no knowledge of horses,
even their own, without asking what is
the inducement that has led them to take
it up.</p>

<p>There are a good many answers. In
the first place, there is the prestige.
You buy a racing stable, and your name
is known not only to your equals&mdash;the
other owners, the members of the
jockey clubs&mdash;but to every office boy
who “plays the ponies,” to every great
lady who wants a competent guide to
the paddock. Mr. Belmont may build
subways and conduct gigantic banking
operations, but it is as the man who
named Belmont Park that he is known
to a majority of his fellow countrymen.
The racegoing community is an epitome
of all society, from the “tout” and
the beggar to the multi-millionaire. A
real aristocracy can be built on so well
organized a foundation, and the owner
of a great stable has the flattery of all
classes in his little world.</p>

<p>Then, too, it is the sign and symbol
of great wealth. Some men prefer to
tell you how rich they are; others load
their wives with jewels, or endow universities.
Others, again, set up a racing
stable. It is a process that sets them in
a small class apart.</p>

<p>But even in a society as materialistic
as ours, the outward symbol is not everything.
A house on the east side of
the park, a perfectly appointed carriage,
a steam yacht&mdash;these are valuable instruments
to those destined to “get on,”
but can by themselves affect very little
for those who are not so destined. Cold-blooded
as the inter-relations of society
seem to be, they are, nevertheless, human
relations, and can never be
achieved by mere things, however much
we may hear to the contrary. Knowing
this, women who desire social advancement
always seek it through the
means of friendships.</p>

<p>But men! The spectacle of a man
struggling for social success was rare
a few years ago. It was always supposed
to be the wives and daughters of
our self-made men who waged the combat.
But nowadays, as society and
business are growing closer and closer,
as more of our great financiers take
prominent social positions, as prominent
social positions become a more and
more valuable asset, we find, as we are
bound to, that men desire such positions
more and more.</p>

<p>This is the damaging suspicion that
clings to men who go into racing after
a past ignorant of horseflesh&mdash;the suspicion
that they are using the sport as a
means of social advancement. Many
people who ought to know will tell you
that no such advantage is offered by
racing, and will point to the veterans of
the turf whose names have never been
heard socially. But the answer to this
is that such men had no ulterior motive,
and would not have wanted social honors,
even if they had come.</p>

<p>Even in countries where the sport is
more seriously taken than here, this
social element mingles with it. In
France racing is the special amusement
of the fastest set&mdash;not of the <i>vieille
noblesse</i>, but of Monsieur Blanc of
dry goods fame, of that set who has
imported its clothes and its slang from
England, the set whose men cannot be
told from well-bred Englishmen, the
set who has invented “le sport.” To
penetrate this set is almost impossible
for a foreigner. Indeed, the only representative
of the Vanderbilt family
who has gone into racing at all has
done so in France. Perhaps even for
him some little aid was necessary in that
difficult circle.</p>

<p>In England, again, the situation is
different. The turf is the serious and
respected sport of all classes. London
is literally empty the day of the Derby.
Many of the most honored names in
England have been, or are, connected
with a great racing stable. It is bound
to have also an important social aspect.
The winning of the Derby has always
been so eagerly desired by Americans
that one is justified in suspecting that
the social prominence attracts them.
Yet here the very seriousness of the
English attitude toward their favorite
sport is clearly to be seen. The Englishman
is quick to detect an unsportsmanlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
attitude; and to use the “sport
of kings” for social purposes is a thing
he finds it hard to forgive.</p>

<p>Over there it is most literally the
“sport of kings,” for it must, if successfully
followed, bring you sooner or
later into contact with the king himself.
This apparently is not always the most
agreeable of experiences, if the story is
true that one of our most conspicuous
expatriates, who has been racing over
there, has been almost forced out of it
on account of a breach of etiquette. It
seems he bid against the king for the
possession of a certain horse, and bid
higher than his majesty cared to go.
The gentleman who was representing
the king was immensely incensed, and
has taken steps to prevent such audacious
competition. Yet to republican
eyes it seems rather hard that the king’s
bid should of itself preclude all others.</p>

<p>Here the position of racing is so
much more ambiguous. It has not the
respect of the country at large. It does
not make one beloved or even celebrated
in the world outside the track.
No political capital could be made out
of it. As to its social uses, I think it is
fair to say that, while no social advantage
necessarily follows, it offers an
immense opportunity to those clever
enough to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>For the main difficulty in the way of
the social aspirant is the first step&mdash;is in
getting to know two or three of the
right people&mdash;two or three are often
sufficient. A large yacht may be a powerful
recommendation, but let her owner
once fill her with the wrong people,
and he were better without her. To
make yourself conspicuous is fatal unless
your companions are those whom
the world envies. To advertise yourself
is, alas! too often to advertise your
undesirable friendships. Many men
seem to think that a coach is the safe
road to success, and will drive round
and round the park secure in the knowledge
that their appointments are perfect
and their horses the best, not
knowing that the effect is being ruined
by their guests, who are evidently unknown
to the world of fashion. The
idea seems to be that it is quite safe to
begin with “frumps,” that they are better
than no one. But this is a great
mistake. Solitude has its dignity.
Common friends have none at all. It
is not easy to progress from them to
the more exclusive. Once you have
identified yourself with the wrong people,
the right ones insist on believing
that that is the kind you really prefer.</p>

<p>For the rich bachelor there are just
two avenues of social ambition. He
may become attentive to a smart girl
not so accustomed to attention as to be
overcritical, or if he is above this sort
of thing, I know of nothing so hopeful
as racing. Here is a sport in which he
may become known without forming
undesirable social ties, without proclaiming
his acquaintance with undesirable
people. There is a chance for him
to meet men of the best position in an
atmosphere congenial to friendship&mdash;a
mutual interest in a great sport. At
the same time there is no role in which
a man may appear better than in that
of a straightforward and generous
sportsman.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/is.png" width="122" height="122" alt="S" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">SHE looked up from
the fire she was
kindling in the small
wood heater; a stout,
rosy-faced old woman,
the sole occupant of
the humble little eating
house at Socorro
Junction. The Spanish name means
succor, and probably marks the place
where some man or party in dire need
was rescued. The man who entered
had a muffled feminine figure clinging
to his arm, and he glanced about suspiciously
as he asked, in a voice which
held a sharp note of anxiety: “Is this
an eating house&mdash;a hotel?”</p>

<p>“This here’s the Wagon Tire
House,” returned its proprietor, rising
and shaking the piñon slivers from her
checked apron.</p>

<p>“Have you rooms&mdash;a parlor&mdash;some
place where this lady can be alone?”</p>

<p>Without awaiting an answer, he
turned and whispered to the veiled
woman, who shuddered and shrank; but
whether from his touch or with fear
of publicity was not apparent. “Take
off your things&mdash;put back that infernal
veil,” he muttered, angrily. “There’s
nothing here to hurt you.”</p>

<p>The removal of the wraps showed a
round, innocent face, with its own pretensions
to beauty. Such prettiness as
it held, however, was just now stricken
out of it by the blanched terror which
dominated every curve and line.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the old woman, surveying
them both. “This ain’t rightly a
hotel. I’ve&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why do you call it one, then?” interrupted
the man, angrily. He placed
his companion in a chair, and stood between
her and the proprietor of the eating
house. “Who are you, anyhow?”
he asked, as he removed his shining silk
hat, and mopped his brow with a snowy
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I’m Huldy Sarvice. Most folks calls
me Aunt Huldy,” she returned, looking
her guest up and down.</p>

<p>The man did not volunteer any return
information; but Huldah, who was
given to communing with herself in regard
to her patrons and summing them
up instantly, supplied the deficiency
with the muttered statement: “And
you’re a gambler. Everything about
you jest hollers ‘Gambler.’” Her eye
fell upon the little figure behind the
tall, black-clad one. It rested a moment
on the crude, pathetically approbative
countenance which should have
been rosy and smiling, “You’re&mdash;&mdash;”
she halted in her unspoken sentence.
“I’m blessed if I know what you are.
You don’t look like no sport’s wife.
You sure don’t look like anything worse.
I guess you’re just a fool. Poor little
soul! I see mighty deep waters in
front of your feet.”</p>

<p>Even while these things were flitting
through Aunt Huldah’s mind, she had
been automatically answering “yes” and
“no” to the somewhat heated inquiries
of her would-be guest. Now, with a
quick patter of little running feet, a
small Mexican boy, with half a pie,
burst in from the kitchen, followed
closely by the irate cook, who was also
his mother. Huldah held her plump
sides and shook with mirth as the little
rascal doubled and turned among the
chairs and table legs, snatching a hasty
bite now and again from his stolen
pie. Nobody knew better than the
proprietor of the Wagon Tire House&mdash;kind,
motherly soul&mdash;that the threats
the Mexican woman hurled after her
offspring were threats only.</p>

<p>At last, when the final morsel was
bolted, Jose permitted himself to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
caught, and burst into loud conventional
sobs as his mother berated him.
The slim, pale little woman crouching
in her chair, her great furred cloak&mdash;painfully
new, as was all the rest of her
expensive wear&mdash;drawn tight around
her, watching this scene with wide,
horrified eyes, sprang up and, in spite
of the man’s restraining hand, ran to
the child.</p>

<p>“Oh! Don’t strike him!” she cried,
kneeling before the boy, her face
bathed in tears. “You’ll be sorry&mdash;sorry&mdash;if
you do! I had a little boy&mdash;a
baby&mdash;and I used to&mdash;to forget
sometimes and&mdash;and be harsh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man caught her shoulder and attempted
to raise her. She shook him off
almost as though she had not noticed
it.</p>

<p>“Louise! Louise!” he said. “This is
ridiculous. Sit down. She isn’t going
to hurt the child.”</p>

<p>But the kneeling woman went on exactly
as though she had not heard.
“You mustn’t strike him. If anything
should happen&mdash;&mdash;” she hesitated. “My
little boy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stole a look over her shoulder
at the angry man.</p>

<p>The Mexican woman’s doubled fist
came down, unclinched and became fingers,
which fumbled at her kitchen
apron. “Is your young son dead,
señora?” she asked, in an awed voice.</p>

<p>“Louise!” remonstrated the man.</p>

<p>The girl whom he addressed shivered,
caught the boy in her arms, and
sobbed wildly: “No, no&mdash;not dead, I
wish he were. I wish I were dead!”</p>

<p>The man leaned down and lifted her
bodily to her feet. “Here,” he said,
pushing her not overgently back into
the chair, “you sit down and get your
nerves quiet.” He turned almost savagely
to Huldah Sarvice, demanding:
“There is surely some place you can
give us where my wife can be alone.
You see how it is here.”</p>

<p>Huldah nodded, looking at her visitor
with shrewd, kindly eyes. “I ’spect
your wife”&mdash;she put a little stress on
the two words, and the girl winced, her
pale face reddening&mdash;“I jest think she’s
better off here among people.”</p>

<p>The man made a muttered objection,
but Huldah went serenely on: “My
lodgin’ rooms is acrost the street, and I
don’t know’s I’ve got a vacant one.
They’s a man with a broken leg in one
of ’em, an’ a feller that’s been drinkin’
a little too much is in another. Two
more of ’em is locked up by the men
that rents ’em. Best sit here till I can
git you a little supper; mebby that’ll
cheer her up some.”</p>

<p>All the time she talked, Aunt Huldah
had been watching the little
woman’s face and behavior, which were
those of a creature under some desperate
pressure; and as she concluded and
turned back to her fire building, she
made her decision. “That man&mdash;husband
or not&mdash;has done something that
she’s knownst to. He’s a gambler;
mebby he’s knifed some feller acrost
the cards; mebby he’s gone further.
But my guess is that she knows of
some crime he’s done, an’ he’s hangin’
onto her for fear she’ll tell.”</p>

<p>She rose from the now kindled fire
for another covert survey of her guests,
who were deep in a whispered conference.
“Yes, and she’d jest about do it,
too. She wants to give him away.”
Again, after a moment of keen observation
on her way to the kitchen, she
added: “An’ he knows it.”</p>

<p>As she went on with her supper, aided
by the Mexican woman, who was used
to her habit of arguing with herself
aloud, she muttered: “What next,
then?” and answered her own question:
“Why, her life ain’t safe with him&mdash;not
a minit!”</p>

<p>Having come to which conclusion,
she gave her helper a few hasty directions,
wiped her hands on her apron and
marched back to the front room, where
all day long the dining table stood set
out with its pink mosquito-net covering.
“I’ve got a room of my own,” she
began, abruptly. “’Tain’t much of a
place, but there’s a bed in it, where
your wife could lay down.”</p>

<p>The two were on their feet in a moment.
Huldah laid hold of the cringing
little shoulder nearest her, and
turned to the door. “It’ll be nigh to
three hours,” she observed, “till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
south-bound comes through. I shan’t
be usin’ the room, and she might as well
git a little rest there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take her over, and stay with
her,” agreed the man, reaching for his
hat.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, sir, that was not my offer,”
objected the old woman. “My room
and my bed she can have&mdash;because she
needs ’em. But it ain’t fixed up, and
I’ll jest have to ask you to let her go
by herself.”</p>

<p>The man’s pale countenance went a
shade whiter; a peculiar trick he had of
showing his teeth without smiling became
suddenly apparent. It rendered
his handsome face repulsive for the moment,
as he grasped the arm which was
not clinging to Aunt Huldah. “Come
back here. Sit down. What do you
mean by pretending that you&mdash;that
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He jerked the girl toward him with
such force that she cried out faintly,
and Huldah’s gray eyes, the one beautiful
feature of her homely countenance,
narrowed and sparkled. “You go and
get us something to eat,” he blustered.
“Food is what she needs. She isn’t well
enough to be alone; and you won’t let
me take her over and stay with her.”</p>

<p>“Please go away,” begged the sobbing
girl, looking pleadingly at Huldah.
“You&mdash;it only makes it worse. I&mdash;I’m
all right here. Please go away.”</p>

<p>And Huldah went, glancing back to
see that the man had seated himself once
more in front of the huddled figure,
looming above her, bending toward her;
and that urgent whispered parley had
begun again.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the Wagon Tire
House was just turning her sizzling
steak in its skillet when the door behind
her opened a crack, and the gambler,
as she had mentally dubbed him,
put his head through.</p>

<p>“Come here,” he said.</p>

<p>Huldah grunted. “I am here,” she
returned. “What is it you want?”</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you”&mdash;impatiently.</p>

<p>“Speak,” suggested the old woman.</p>

<p>“But I’ve got something to say that I
don’t care to yell to every fool on the
street.” He stared malevolently at the
broad, blue calico back and half turned
to retrace his steps; but no, he needed a
woman’s help&mdash;he must have it; and he
finally began, in an anxious, reluctant
half whisper: “What do you think of
her? Is she really sick?”</p>

<p>“I think she’ll die, all right,” answered
the old woman, without turning
her head or glancing up from her cooking.</p>

<p>“You do!” sneered the man, with a
sudden loudness of tone. “You think
she’ll die! You women are always
using that word. I never saw a woman
in a tight place yet but what she began
whining that she believed it would kill
her&mdash;that she’d die.”</p>

<p>“Well, and they die, too, sometimes&mdash;don’t
they?”</p>

<p>A little sound or movement in the
room behind him brought the man’s
glance around with such a malignant
scowl that Huldah, noting it, deemed
her time to speak out had come. “See
here, sir,” she began, turning away
from the stove&mdash;“Manuelita, tend to
that steak, and don’t let it burn, for
goodness’ sake&mdash;see here, sir, you know
a lot more’n I do about what ails that
woman in there. But I know enough
to know that she’s goin’ to die if she’s
driv’ like you’ve been drivin’ her.”</p>

<p>“Like I’ve been driving her!” echoed
the man, angrily. “She’s the one that’s
making it hot for me. There’s nothing
the matter with her.”</p>

<p>“All right,” returned Huldah, applying
herself once more to the cooking.
“If there’s nothing the matter of her,
what did you come out here to ask me
about it for?” Sudden rage mastered
her as she worked over the steak gravy.
She whirled and shook a finger at her
interlocutor so sharply that he drew
back. “I tell you that little creatur’ in
the room behind you is a-goin’ to die
if she ain’t let up on,” she finished, impressively.</p>

<p>Fear, indecision and rage contended
upon the man’s face. “Oh, Lord!” he
ejaculated, “if one woman can’t raise
enough row, there’s always another to
help her. Well, come in here. You
can take her over. To your own room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
mind&mdash;nowhere else. And let nobody
else see her or talk to her. You’ll come
right back, and not stay with her.” He
looked at Huldah Sarvice’s strong, benevolent
face, which smiled upon him
inscrutably. “I expect I’m a fool to risk
it,” he muttered. “But&mdash;well, come in.”</p>

<p>“Stay with her!” echoed Huldah,
tossing up her head with a peculiar, free
motion which belonged to her in times
of excitement. “Stay with her? <i>I</i>
don’t want to stay with your wife. I’ve
got my work to do. I don’t spy on nobody&mdash;no
matter how bad things looks
for ’em.”</p>

<p>She had spoken the latter words in
an undertone, as she gathered the
drooping girl and her belongings upon
a capable arm. Now, as a heavy,
drumming roar became audible, she
added, in excitement: “Land sakes!
There’s a train. No, it can’t be no
train; but for sure them’s engines out
on the Magdalena Branch! I’ve got to
fly ’round and git supper for them train
crews. All the boys o’ the Magdalena
Branch eats with me.” She made
as though to release her charge, saying
sharply: “I guess I ain’t hardly time
to take your wife acrost&mdash;let alone
hangin’ ’round to chat with her.”</p>

<p>“Hi, colonel! That big trunk of
yours bu’st open when we tried to get
it off the freight,” announced a man’s
voice in the doorway. “Want to come
over and see to it?”</p>

<p>This was the help that Huldah could
have asked for. The man addressed as
“colonel” turned from one to the other
with a worried look. “I guess I’ve got
to,” he replied to the brakeman. “How
bad is it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it,” returned the other,
“but Billy said it was plumb bu’st, and
the things fallin’ out. It’ll have to be
roped, I guess.”</p>

<p>As the men hurried away in the direction
of the station, Huldah turned
briskly and tightened her arm about
the girl. “Now, honey,” she whispered.
And they hastened across the
straggling red mud road in the face of
a shower whose large drops were beginning
to pelt down like hail. Aunt
Huldah gathered up her petticoats and
ran. “I’ll have to git them winders
shut,” she panted. “I hope to gracious
Manuelita’s got the sense to shut ’em in
the other house.”</p>

<p>The roaring of engines which Huldah
had mentioned as on the Magdalena
Branch came more distinctly now.
“Looks like there must be three or four
of ’em&mdash;engines&mdash;one right behind
t’other,” the old woman muttered. “I’ll
jest git you fixed comfortable over here,
honey, and shut them winders, an’ then
I must run back.”</p>

<p>But when she would have done so,
the girl clung to her with shaking hands.
“Oh, don’t leave me!” she sobbed.
“Don’t let that man know where I am.
Hide me.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t your husband, then?” hazarded
Huldah.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;no!” moaned the girl.
“My husband’s a freight conductor on
this road&mdash;Billy Gaines. You’ve seen
him. He told me about you and the
Wagon Tire House&mdash;about your having
a wagon tire in front of it to beat
on to call to meals. I expect he’s eaten
many a meal here. He might come
now; and then if he saw me&mdash;and that
man&mdash;and&mdash;oh, hide me!”</p>

<p>Aunt Huldah let the head rest upon
her shoulder, the shamed face hidden.
“Who is this feller they call colonel,
child?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p>“He owned&mdash;the house we lived in&mdash;in
El Paso,” came the muffled explanation.
“He’s rich, and&mdash;and very refined.”</p>

<p>“I know a place that’s full of jest
such refined fellers,” muttered Huldah,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Billy didn’t seem to love the baby as he&mdash;as&mdash;and
Colonel Emerson is very fond
of children&mdash;he’s devoted to my baby&mdash;or
I thought he was. And he said that
it was cause enough for me to leave
Billy. And if I should leave him&mdash;if
I should leave Billy&mdash;if I should get a
divorce from him&mdash;he said&mdash;Colonel
Emerson said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me what he <i>said</i>, honey
child,” urged Huldah. “What’d he
<i>do</i>? Where’s your baby?”</p>

<p>Oh, then the poor little mother clung
with strangling sobs to the stronger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
older woman. “I’m so scared,” she
whispered. “He got me all these nice
things&mdash;ain’t my clothes awfully pretty?&mdash;and
he promised we’d bring the baby
with us. He says he’s taking me to his
mother, and that I can stay there until
I get my divorce&mdash;because, you know,
Billy has treated me awfully mean, and
he don’t care&mdash;Billy&mdash;he don’t care a
thing on earth about me nor the baby
any more.”</p>

<p>She reiterated these last words with a
piteous look of entreaty into the kind
gray eyes bent upon her, repeated them
as a little child repeats a lesson which
has been laboriously taught to it. Huldah
looked at her with infinite pity.
“Where’s your baby?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“That’s what scares me!” cried the
wife of Billy Gaines. “He said&mdash;Colonel
Emerson said&mdash;when he met me at the
station, and he hadn’t sent for the baby
like he promised to&mdash;that he was going
to have some man that he knew go and
get the boy and take it to his mother’s
house, but that it wouldn’t do for it to
travel with us, because we could be
traced by it. I”&mdash;the pretty lips trembled&mdash;“I
never was away from my baby
a night in my life. I don’t know if
anybody knows where to get his little
night drawers. He always wears a little
sack, extra, at night, because he’s a
great one for throwing his arms out
and getting the covers off them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was running on like a crazed
thing, with these little fond details,
when Huldah Sarvice’s strong voice
interrupted her. “Thank God!” said
the old woman, heaving a mighty sigh
of relief. “If you’re a good mother,
you’re worth savin’. I’m goin’ right
over now an’ telegraft to your husband.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Don’t do that!” cried the
other. “He’ll be killed. You mustn’t.
Don’t. He’ll be killed!”</p>

<p>“Killed!” snorted Huldah. Hers was
the rough-and-ready code of the West.
“Killed&mdash;and serve him right!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean Colonel Emerson,” remonstrated
the frantic girl. “Sometimes
I think he’s a bad man&mdash;an awful
man&mdash;anyhow, he’ll just have to
stand it if anything happens. It’s Billy
I’m thinking about. The colonel has
shot three or four men&mdash;he’ll kill my
poor Billy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Huldah smiled to herself in the gathering
darkness. The problem was becoming
easier and easier. But the girl’s
strangled, sobbing voice went on: “And
I couldn’t bear to see Billy. I don’t
dare to have him see me when he knows
about this. I can’t face him. If you
say you’re going to telegraph to him, I’ll
run right straight to Colonel Emerson
and get him to take me away somewhere.”</p>

<p>Huldah puckered her lips&mdash;had she
been a man she would have whistled.
She saw no way but to go with the girl
and fight it out with her tempter.
“Come,” she said, a little roughly for
Huldah. “I’ll go back with you.”</p>

<p>She whom the old woman would have
saved turned like a hunted thing, as to
elude her benefactress. Huldah clung
to her arm, and they struggled thus to
the doorway. Here the thunder of engines
toward Magdalena once more arrested
the attention of the proprietor of
the Wagon Tire House. It had increased
to a deafening uproar; the rain
fell like bullets; and even as they drew
back, frightened, there was no street to
be seen&mdash;only a flood of swirling yellow
water, running like a tail race between
the lodging rooms and the little eating
house. “My Lord!” groaned Huldah.
“I might ’a’ knowed ’twa’n’t engines.
Hit’s a cloudburst, above&mdash;the big arroyo’s
up.”</p>

<p>It was true. The red gash which
through nine-tenths of the year lay dry
and yawning beside the tracks of the
little Magdalena Branch railway was
brimmed with the same tide which
swept the street. And down it, as they
looked, came a wall of writhing, tormented
water, nearly five feet high.</p>

<p>There had been a cloudburst in the
mountains above, whence came such
trickle as fed the arroyo in the dry season.
Twice before had this thing happened,
and the little eating house stood
upon stilts of cottonwood logs to be
above the flood line, while the lodging
house was on higher ground.</p>

<p>The watching women saw the flood
reach the railway track, beat upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
embankment with upraised, clinched
hands, tear at it with outspread fingers
in an access of fury, wrench up the
rails yet bolted to the ties, and fling
them forward on its crest as it plunged
on. The two little houses, standing isolated
from the town and nearer to the
railroad tracks than any other, were
now in an open waste of water, the current
sweeping swiftly between them, an
eddy lapping in their back yards.</p>

<p>As Huldah saw Manuelita’s frightened
face at a window of the Wagon
Tire House, she made a trumpet of her
plump hands and shouted: “Don’t you
be scared, Manuelita&mdash;hear? Keep up
the fire, and make a b’iler of coffee. I’ll
be over soon’s I can git thar!”</p>

<p>Billy Gaines’ wife looked down at the
water with relief. “He can’t come
across that,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“No, he can’t,” agreed Aunt Huldah.
“An’ you come an’ lay down on
my bed. Slip off your shoes, an’ loosen
your clothes, but don’t undress. This
house is safe, I reckon; but no knowin’
what might happen.”</p>

<p>All that night Huldah Sarvice
worked, with the strength of a man and
the knowledge of a seasoned frontiers-woman.
The injured were brought to
the lodging house or the eating house,
just as it happened. When a hastily improvised
boat came to their aid, she
went in it over to see that some refreshment
was prepared for the workers;
and later, when the sullen flood receded
to a languid swell, she paddled back
and forth on foot, her petticoats gathered
in one sweep of her arm, and whatever
was necessary to carry held fast
with the other.</p>

<p>“You’ll get your death, Aunt Huldah,”
remonstrated the agent, when she
had struggled across to the station to
send a telegram to Billy Gaines.</p>

<p>“I reckon not,” she returned, with
twinkling eye. “Seems like you can’t
drown me. I’ve been flooded out six
times; twict at El Captain, once at
Blowout and now three times here; and
I ain’t drownded yet. This is a good
long telegraft that I’m a-sendin’; but I
reckon the railroad won’t grudge it to
me.”</p>

<p>“You bet they won’t,” returned the
boy, heartily, as he addressed himself
to his key. “I’ll add a message of my
own to a fellow I know at El Paso, and
get him to hunt Billy up if he’s on duty
to-night.”</p>

<p>Huldah beamed. “That’s awful good
of you,” she returned; “but if you had
seen that little woman over there a runnin’
from one window to another, a
wringin’ her hands and carryin’ on so
that I’m ’most afraid to leave her alone,
you’d be glad to do it.”</p>

<p>As she splashed back to her tired
helpers and the injured at the Wagon
Tire House, the old woman muttered to
herself: “He’s a good boy. It’s better
to have good friends than to be
rich;” and never reflected for an instant
that no personal benefit had been
conferred upon herself in the matter.</p>

<p>With the simple wisdom of a good
woman who knows well the human
heart, Huldah set poor Louise Gaines to
attending upon the worst injured of the
flood sufferers, and took her promptly
in to see the one corpse which so far
had been found floating in an eddy after
the waters receded a little. It was that
of a young Mexican girl from the village
above. The little fair woman went
down on her knees beside the stretcher.
“Oh, I wish it was me!” she cried.
“Why couldn’t it have been me? She’s
young, and I expect she wanted to live&mdash;why
didn’t God take me?”</p>

<p>“Now, now,” remonstrated Aunt
Huldah, with a touch of wholesome
sternness. “I didn’t bring you in here
to carry on about your own troubles&mdash;that’s
selfish. I brung you to make
this poor girl look fit to be laid away.
You can do it better’n I can, and there’s
nobody else for to do it. Likely her
folks is all drownded, too.”</p>

<p>And Billy Gaines’ wife rose up and
wiped her eyes, and went to work in
something of the spirit that Huldah had
hoped.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock in the gray of the
morning when the wrecking train from
El Paso came through; and Billy Gaines
was aboard it. The poor little wife had
had attacks of hysteric terror all night
long at the thought of his coming;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and now she lay exhausted and half
sleeping upon the lounge in the dining
room. Huldah herself felt a little
qualm of fear as she opened the kitchen
door to the tall figure buttoned in the
big ulster. For the first time, she wondered
where the man Emerson was, and
hoped that he had taken the one train
which left Socorro going northward,
just before the flood struck them. But
the hope was a faint one; more likely
he was up in the town, cut off from
them temporarily by the water which
still ran between; and when he and
Billy Gaines met, she doubted not that
there would be another bloody reckoning
such as the West knows well.</p>

<p>If she had doubted, her questions
would have been answered when she
looked into the frank gray eyes of the
man who met her, a trifle stern and
very resolute. “I’ve come for my wife,”
he said, breathing a little short, “and
if Jim Emerson’s in the house, I want
to see him.”</p>

<p>“Come in here,” said the old woman,
drawing the newcomer into a small
section of chaos which was generally
known as the pantry. “I remember
you now, an’ I guess you’re a decenter
man than the run of ’em; but I want to
have a word with you before you go in
to that poor girl. You see, I want to
be sure that you’ve looked on both sides
of it. You pass all right among the
men&mdash;I hear you well spoke of&mdash;but
how many things can you ricollect that
you’ve done that are jest as bad as what
she’s done?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” said Billy Games, almost
with impatience. “I understand, Aunt
Huldah.”</p>

<p>“Mebby you do,” said the old woman;
“but I want to be sure. Where was
you when this poor little soul was left
to herself&mdash;and that scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“I was over in Mexico on a six weeks’
hunting trip.”</p>

<p>“You was! Well, then, after all, who
done this thing&mdash;who’s really to
blame?”</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;you bet,” came the deep-voiced
answer. “I don’t hold it against
you a bit, Aunt Huldah; but you’re
working on the wrong trail. You think
you’ve got a great big job ahead of you
trying to make me see this thing right.
But I’ll remind you that it’s eight hours
from El Paso here&mdash;eight night hours&mdash;and
your telegram was pretty complete.
You left the man out; and so
will I&mdash;until I meet him.” The firm
jaw squared itself heavily; and Huldah
sighed as she realized that the law of
blood for honor must be met.</p>

<p>The man had carried one arm almost
as though it were injured; and she now
glanced down at it as he moved it and
fumbled in the folds of his big overcoat.
His voice softened beautifully. “I’ve
got something here,” he said, “that
ought to show you that I know and
understand, and am going to behave
myself.”</p>

<p>He opened his great cloak and
showed, lying upon his breast asleep, a
baby of about two years old, who
stirred, put up a wandering little hand
and murmured: “Daddy,” as he settled
himself for a longer nap.</p>

<p>“Bless his heart!” murmured Huldah,
in the richest tones of her strong,
heartsome voice. She wiped the tears
from her eyes on a corner of the check
apron. “I guess you’ll do, Billy. You
seem to have the makin’s of a tol’able
decent feller in you. You’ve got the
only medicine right there that your
poor little, half crazy wife needs.”
And she pushed him toward the door of
the deserted dining room.</p>

<p>There was a long, agonized cry:
“O&mdash;o&mdash;oh, Billy!” Then the big voice
talked brokenly and gently for a time,
choking sobs interrupting it; and Huldah
could hear, at first, the thin, shrill
terror of the woman’s tones, very sharp
and pleading; finally an eloquent silence.</p>

<p>She glanced in to see Billy Gaines sitting
with what she called “both of his
children&mdash;for the little woman’s ’most
as much of a baby as her boy”&mdash;asleep;
the mother with her head upon his
shoulder, while the child lay in the laps
of both of them.</p>

<p>“Lord, but that’s a sight for sore
eyes!” she ruminated, as she lifted the
coffee boiler from the stove and sent
Manuelita to lie down and get a rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>“But there’s the colonel,” she pursued.
“There’s goin’ to be awful times
when him and Billy Gaines meets.”
Then she smiled at herself and went on:
“Jest listen to a old woman like me tryin’
to tell how it ort to come out. We’re
all God’s children. I reckon the colonel’s
His child”&mdash;she seemed to have a
little doubt upon this point&mdash;“an’ I
reckon God’ll take care of him.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to her half-spoken
thought, there came the tramp of stumbling
feet, somebody beat upon the door,
and a voice called: “Mrs. Sarvice!
Aunt Huldah! We’ve just found another
body over by the railroad tracks.
Can we bring him in here, or shall we
take it over to the other house?”</p>

<p>Huldah hurried out, to turn down the
blanket they had drawn over the stark
form and look upon the dead gambler’s
face. “Carry him to the lodgin’ house,
pore feller,” she said, gently.</p>

<p>God had taken care of the colonel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">London</span> has
begun to
howl sensationally
about the
American Theatrical
Syndicate, and
to discuss the possibilities
of its invasion
of London.</p>

<p>Of course this is the warm season, when
snake stories and sea-serpent legends
are distinctly in order. Therefore the
machinations of the American Theatrical
Syndicate have made good reading,
and plenty of space has been given to
the subject. One journalist has suggested
that the playwrights of England
and the United States form a league,
destined to break up the trust, very
much after the style of the Authors’
Society in France. “Why should they
not form themselves into a society,”
asks this writer, “for the protection not
only of their own interests, but of the
interests of the theater, of the interests
of the actors, and of the interests of
the public? As the trust snaps up an
actor when once his reputation is established,
so it deals with dramatists.
Once a dramatist has made a mark, the
trust practically buys him up; that is
to say, it makes him an offer outright
for all his work to come. That is part
of the infernal system.”</p>

<p>All of which is quite good, and true,
and logical. It reads remarkably well,
with just the spice of wholesome plaint
that one loves to excavate. After a
month of continuous theater-going in
London, however&mdash;from the Strand to
Piccadilly Circus, and from Piccadilly
Circus to Shaftesbury Avenue&mdash;I can’t
help reflecting that if <i>the</i> syndicate or
any syndicate had been let loose in London
this year, with the option of cornering
everything in sight, the fact
remains that there is scarcely a production
in London
worth transplanting.
Furthermore,
the fear that an
American invasion
would deal a death-blow
to London
art seems absurd.
I haven’t found
any art to death-blow.</p>

<p>Nearly everything that London writers
have said of the syndicate is true,
and, perhaps, not stringent enough, but&mdash;with
an accent on the “but”&mdash;how it
could possibly harm London goodness
only knows. Never has theatrical entertainment
in the English metropolis
been at a lower ebb. A few of its features
will be done in New York this
year, and they will prove exactly what
I have said. English playwrights seem
to be suffering from too much money,
for they apparently lack the stimulus to
struggle. That money may, of course,
have been contributed by American
managers, who buy “pig-in-a-poke”
fashion, but if that be so, there are not
enough “independent” playwrights to
form a society. As for leaguing themselves
with American playwrights&mdash;well,
puzzle: find the American playwrights.</p>

<p>The saddest case of perverted humor
I have sampled in a very long time is
that of J.&nbsp;M. Barrie’s play&mdash;or whatever
it chooses to call itself&mdash;entitled “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire,”
at the Duke of York’s
Theater. Barrie must, indeed, be very
“comfortably fixed,” for no other condition
could conceivably call forth such
a miserable guy on the theater-going
public as this “three-act page from a
daughter’s diary.” Naturally it has attracted
a good deal of attention, for
Barrie has done noble things in his day,
and “The Little Minister” still lives as
a monumentally delightful achievement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
But “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire” is a “satire”
built on such a weak and irritating
foundation that it is difficult to consider
it except with contempt&mdash;which is a
cruel way of looking at Barrie.</p>

<p>The heroine, or central figure, or
point of attack, in “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire”
is a romantic young girl, who
has been to so many “matinées” that
she has grown to look upon life as a
theatrical performance. At first you
think that <i>Amy Grey</i> is going to be extremely
amusing, as she chats satirically
of her life, with her boon companion&mdash;another
matinée fiend. <i>Amy’s</i> father
and mother return from India after an
absence of a good many years, and
Barrie plunges into a plot.</p>

<p>The stagestruck girl has always heard
that when a woman visits a man’s
rooms at midnight there are illicit relations
that should be immediately broken
up. She hears her mother promise to
call upon <i>Stephen Rollo</i> at midnight,
and assumes, with much girlish glee,
that her mother needs rescuing. The
entire motive of “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire”
lurks in Barrie’s effort to be funny
around this cruelly topsy-turvy, and
rather nauseating, idea.</p>

<p>The principal act occurs in the “man’s
rooms”&mdash;with the girl, the mother and
the man. Barrie, in a positive ecstasy
of ghoulish “humor,” allows the mother
to understand the girl’s idea. She
clamors for her daughter’s love, and believes
that the best way to secure it will
be to feign guilt, so that the girl can
“rescue” her. This she does. <i>Amy</i> believes
that she has saved her mamma
from a horrible fate&mdash;mamma caters
diligently to that suggestion&mdash;and the
play ends with <i>Amy’s</i> betrothal to the
man in the case.</p>

<p>In this play Barrie has violated sheer
decency of sentiment. It is all very well
to shower satire upon the matinée girl&mdash;she
can stand it, and has stood it full
many a time and oft&mdash;but to mix her up
in the imaginary adultery of her own
mother&mdash;and as a joke, saving the
mark!&mdash;gives one such a disagreeable
shock, that recovery from its effects is
quite out of the question. To be even
more delicately humorous, Barrie might
have introduced the grandmother under
similarly suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>It is all very well to write caviare, but
the caviare must be fresh and not
putrid. Barrie’s “humor” in “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire”
has the taint of decay&mdash;as
it had the germ of acute dyspepsia in
that atrocity produced in New York under
the title of “Little Mary.” Real
humor attacks hereditary sentiment with
delicacy, and a certain amount of timidity.
To completely realize this you
have but to study George Bernard
Shaw, who, while he flouts a thousand
traditions, and is rarely amusing unless
he is flouting, does so with a keen appreciation
of what he is doing. The redoubtable
George may even scoff occasionally
at filial sentiment, but he would
never dredge humor from the imaginary
sin of a mother, used as a joke to please
her own stagestruck daughter. At the
close of “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire” one
wondered what <i>Amy</i>, after her marriage
to the man in the case, would
think of the maudlin situation. And
this, please your grace, has been announced
as Barrie’s crowning fantasy!
Fortunately, we have “Peter Pan” to
hear from in New York. Not having
seen that, I pin my faith to it, for I
want to hold on to Barrie a bit longer,
in spite of “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire.”</p>

<p>This “page from a daughter’s diary”
was preceded by a sketch, also by Barrie,
entitled “Pantaloon,” and programed
as “a plea for an ancient family.”
There is no need to discuss this
one-act trifle, with its pathos and bathos,
in extraordinary blend, and no single
salient idea to carry it through. The
elopement of <i>Harlequin</i> and <i>Columbine</i>,
with the jilting of <i>Clown</i>, and the distress
of <i>Pantaloon</i> may perchance be a
“plea for an ancient family,” and as
there are all sorts of pleas, you are possibly
allowed to pay your money and
take your choice.</p>

<p>It was Ellen Terry who played <i>Alice</i>,
in the “Sit-by-the-Fire” affair. Poor
Ellen Terry! To my mind it was sad
and disheartening. Why should an
actress who has had such a joyous career
as that which fell to Miss Terry’s
lot, elect, in her ultra maturity, to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
a bad part in a bad play&mdash;and not too
well? There is tragedy in this continued,
and&mdash;I should say&mdash;unnecessary
service. Probably there are still roles
that Miss Terry might acceptably play,
but as the forty-year-old mother in this
wretched piece one could but feel sorry
for her&mdash;and sorry for those who saw
her. I have heard that Miss Ethel
Barrymore plays the part in the United
States. I can’t believe it until I see it.</p>

<p>Miss Irene Vanbrugh&mdash;you remember
her in “The Gay Lord Quex”&mdash;was
the matinée girl, with much force.
There are flashes of humor in the part,
and Miss Vanbrugh made the most of
them. For the benefit of those who
may see “Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire” on the
American side of the pond, the rest of
the cast was made up of Aubrey Smith,
A.&nbsp;E. Mathews, Kenneth Douglas, Lettice
Fairfax&mdash;who was once in Augustin
Daly’s New York company&mdash;Dora
Hole, Edith Craig and Hilda Trevelyan.</p>

<p>Always at this time of year there is
an influx of foreign actresses into London.
They come; they are seen; but
they never conquer. They must be awfully
tired of it, for history has such a
sad way of repeating itself. This year,
however, one French actress has made
a good deal of a stir, but under such
distinctly new conditions that the stir
is quite intelligible. This young woman,
Madame Simone Le Bargy, of whom I
wrote you last year when I reviewed
“Le Retour de Jerusalem” from Paris,
was brought to London by George Alexander,
the actor-manager of the St.
James Theater, <i>not</i> for a season “on her
own,” but as his leading lady, and in
English, too!</p>

<p>A French actress in English! Could
anything be more unusual? Sarah
Bernhardt, who has been cavorting
around the English-speaking world for
portentous yet vulgar fractions of a
century, never managed to acquire even
a suspicion of English; Rêjane, who has
done London and New York pretty
thoroughly, would have an artistic fit
at the idea of juggling with English, at
her time of life; Jane Hading, Jeanne
Granier and others are quite willing to
play anywhere, but it must be in
French.</p>

<p>Madame Simone Le Bargy played
the leading rôle in “The Man of the
Moment,” at the St. James Theater, and
was duly and unselfishly boomed by Mr.
George Alexander, as “of the Gymnase
Théâtre, Paris. Her first appearance
in England.” The piece was an adaptation,
by Harry Melvill, of “L’Adversaire,”
by Alfred Capus and Emmanuel
Arène. The English actor-manager
was a wise man in his London generation.
He had a weak play, most indifferently
adapted, but he had Le Bargy,
and for a while she caught the town.</p>

<p>While English leading ladies must
have fumed at Alexander’s neglect of
“home talent,” Madame Le Bargy
showed that it is quite possible not only
to play with grace and facility in a foreign
language, but actually to prove
more intelligible than a good many London
actresses who flatter themselves
that they speak good English. Madame
Le Bargy’s English was an absolute revelation.
Naturally it had an accent&mdash;a
delightful one&mdash;and Paris was stamped
on everything she said, but compared
with Mrs. Fiske in New York, or Miss
Ashwell in London, Madame Le Bargy’s
diction was wonderful. Every word
she uttered was intelligible. She rattled
off various speeches almost as
quickly as she might have done in
French, but never once did their meaning
miscarry. I’ve seen all sorts of foreign
actresses waylay the English
language&mdash;Modjeska and Janauschek
being in the list&mdash;but seldom have such
results as those given by this little, thin,
nervous Frenchwoman been attained.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it is said that Madame
Le Bargy had never been in London before,
and that she had acquired English
in France. In which case, I would suggest
that half a dozen popular New
York actresses&mdash;I won’t mention names&mdash;should
sail for France at an early
date, and see if they could learn English
there. It is as difficult to acquire in
London as it is in New York.</p>

<p>“The Man of the Moment” was saved
from rapid extinction by the little Gymnase
actress. It had four acts, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
two of which you could have slept comfortably
while various alleged French
characters sat round drawing rooms
and talked endlessly about nothing
whatsoever. Then, in the third act, you
learned that <i>Marianne Darlay</i>, the wife
of <i>Maurice</i>, had been lured to infidelity
by a dark gentleman named <i>Langlade</i>.
As she still loved her husband, and
didn’t love <i>Langlade</i>, this little escapade
failed entirely to interest. The
“great scene” occurred when the wife
gave herself away to the husband, and
the play ended with a vista of divorce.
Divorce, in real life, may be a serenely
satisfactory settlement of domestic
wrangles, but on the stage its unromantic
practicality has not yet succeeded
in appealing, except in farce.
“The Man of the Moment” had no dramatic
action, and no movement of any
sort. You were unable to sympathize
with the woman, or to feel much interest
in the man. In fact, “The Man
of the Moment” must have been so-called
because he had none.</p>

<p>Capus in French is always exhilarating.
The “chatter” is refreshing and
genuinely amusing, but translated into
English, it seemed extremely dull. Mr.
Melvill did poor Capus into the sort of
language that is encountered in burlesque
at little Mr. Weber’s music hall.
The result was fatal. Yet, in addition
to Madame Le Bargy’s very excellent
work, there was George Alexander,
whose efforts were most praiseworthy.
He seemed perfectly satisfied to take
what was assuredly second place in the
cast. “The Man of the Moment” was
beautifully put on, as is every production
at the St. James Theater. George
Alexander is one of the few London
actors who have not been to the United
States within the last decade&mdash;in fact,
he has never been, except as a member
of Irving’s forces, many years ago&mdash;and
the abstinence seems to agree with him.
He does more, and he does it more luxuriously,
than the traveling English actor
whom we have seen so often. Perhaps
it is true, after all, that a rolling
stone gathers no moss&mdash;though I should
hate to believe that there could possibly
be anything in a popular proverb.</p>

<p>While one little foreign actress was
capturing London by her clever manipulation
of London’s language, others
were not as happy. Eleanora Duse’s
season at the Messrs. Shubert’s new
Waldorf Theater, in the new street
called Aldwych, on the Strand, must
have been very discouraging to the
haughty lady herself. In fact, it is asserted
that she will never again appear
in England. Half-filled houses are
something that must be distressing to
the “artistic temperament,” and Duse
played to a most elongated series of
them. Few people seemed to know that
she was in London. In New York we,
in our occasionally provincial appreciation
of an actress whom we are unable
to understand&mdash;and probably <i>because</i>
we can’t understand her&mdash;go into ecstasies
over Duse, and pack the theater
to overflowing. London is too sophisticated.
Duse made no stir at all this
time. Even the critics gave her but
merely polite attention. Possibly in
English she could charm the English-speaking
world. But, save in the case
of Madame Simone Le Bargy, nobody
seems to think that worth while. Perhaps
it isn’t.</p>

<p>As for the tireless Sarah&mdash;she gets
on one’s nerves. After a brief season
at the Coronet Theater, in Notting Hill,
where she produced her own version of
“Adrienne Lecouvreur,” and Victor
Hugo’s “Angelo”&mdash;which fell flat as a
pancake&mdash;Sarah rushed through the
English provinces with Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, in their freak performance of
“Pelleas and Melisande.” In a manufacturing
town, like Birmingham, for
instance, Maeterlinck, at advanced
prices, seemed like some ghastly joke!
Sarah visits England annually, in a
veritable desperation of energy, but it
is very seldom worth her while. This
year she was less interesting than Madame
Le Bargy; and the same may be
said of Réjane.</p>

<p>I had not been in London very long
before I found myself battling with the
musical comedy whirlpool. It hedged
me in; panic-stricken, I tried to get myself
free. A dreadful sensation of helplessness
overcame me. In a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of numbed protest, I was carried along
with the torrent, and it was a long time
before I finally emerged. My system
being impoverished and quite run down
by a strenuous musical-comedy dose in
New York, I was not in the state of
mind to render the continued ordeal
endurable.</p>

<p>Yet a very estimable gentleman, Max
Beerbohm, who is supposed to write
fantasy, whimsicality or oddity, has undertaken
to champion musical comedy.
The championship of “Max,” however,
is a sort of “swan song” for musical
comedy. He says: “Were musical
comedy other than it is, the highest intellects
in the land would be deprived of
an incomparable safety valve. And what
would become of that ‘fifty millions&mdash;mostly
fools’&mdash;who find in musical
comedy an art-form conducted precisely
on the level of their understanding? I
have no sympathy at all with the growls
so constantly emitted by professional
critics of this art-form. Of course
musical comedy might be made a vehicle
for keen satire, for delicate humor,
for gracious lyricism, and what
not. But I prefer that it should remain
as it is. Let us continue to cry aloud
for a serious drama, by all means, but
long live mere silliness in mere entertainment.”</p>

<p>One could almost regret that this
writer had no “job” in New York City
as a “press agent.” He writes with such
<i>verve</i> on topics of which he is avowedly
ignorant, for at the beginning of
his defense, he says: “Nor do I ever
see a musical comedy of my own accord.”
That is it. That is precisely it.
It is so easy to speak of an “art-form,”
or an “incomparable safety valve,” when
you’d run a mile or jump into anything
to avoid it.</p>

<p>There are four musical-comedy productions
in London that a sheer sense
of duty compelled me to see. Such a
list! It was unescapable. No self-deception
or hypocrisy could possibly
excuse a traveling critic from sampling
this quartet. One can always elude a
solitary performance, for it proves nothing
and makes no point. But four of a
kind at one fell swoop! Surely, if four
West End theaters can devote themselves
irrevocably to this “art-form,”
one has no right to balk, or to look the
other way. The four affairs in question
are “The Little Michus,” at Daly’s,
“Lady Madcap,” at the Prince of
Wales’, “The Spring-Chicken,” at the
Gaiety, and “The Catch of the Season,”
at the Vaudeville. Three of them are
scheduled for production in New York,
but I should say that one only has a
fighting chance, and that “The Catch of
the Season.”</p>

<p>It had the usual array of sponsor-meddlers&mdash;two
for the pieces, one for
the lyrics, two for the music; and its
aim is higher than that of the conventional
brand, for it is a modernization of
the Cinderella story&mdash;a story that has
never shown any sign of age, and probably
never will. Nobody has tried to do
anything clever with Cinderella. There
is no satire, very little humor and nothing
in the least skittish. It is just
pretty, and at this Vaudeville Theater it
is Miss Ellaline Terriss, London’s
sample Christmas card beauty, who does
the Cinderella act. It is not necessary
to say very much more about “The
Catch of the Season.” Its music is
trivial, and its book is worse. But its
specialties please, and one can sit
through this little entertainment without
that sense of degradation that the brand
sometimes induces. That is a good deal.
For New York many alterations will be
made&mdash;I write in the future tense,
though when these lines are read, they
can be translated into the past&mdash;and I
hope a happy one&mdash;new music will be
introduced, and Miss Edna May placed
in Ellaline Terriss’ dainty shoes.</p>

<p>Of “The Little Michus,” at Daly’s,
and “The Spring Chicken,” at the Gaiety,
I am scarcely able to write. Two
weeks have elapsed since I saw them,
and not a single impression of consequence
remains. I remember that I was
unutterably bored, but I can’t quite recall
which was the duller performance
of the two. At the time I compared
them both with “The Cingalee,” the
New York failure of which I correctly
prophesied last summer. I should like
to suggest that even in the musical-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>comedy
line I am still able to scent novelty,
whenever the slightest aroma occurs.
It is the expectation of this that
keeps me alive during a performance.
Without that expectation I should honestly
stay away, for I have arrived at a
stage when I am not courting martyrdom.</p>

<p>The George Edwardes shows have of
late displayed a marked tendency to a
sort of stupefying monotony. Either
the fear of risking a new idea, or the
hope that the old ones have not become
too abjectly ancient, has kept them in
the one groove. It is quite remarkable
when you come to think of it. Even
the supply of people has comparatively
failed. The Gaiety girls have married&mdash;some
of them have even taken unto
themselves peers&mdash;and a new stock has
neglected to materialize. In “The Little
Michus,” which is supposed to detail the
experiences of two young girls who look
precisely alike, but who have been
changed at birth, these two prominent
rôles were intrusted to Adrienne Augarde
and Mabel Green&mdash;the latter absolutely
unknown. In “The Spring
Chicken,” which, I may add, is just as
calamitous as its title, it was Miss Gertie
Millar who had to uphold the traditions
of the Gaiety. A pretty girl, a bright
little actress and a fairly melodious
warbler is Miss Millar, but George Edwardes
used to do better than this.</p>

<p>“Lady Madcap” was the best of the
three George Edwardes shows in London.
Probably that is why it has been
left untouched by the American manager.
I do not say that any of these
entertainments are worth exporting.
To trot such drivel across the Atlantic
Ocean, while the United States still has
its lunatic asylums with numbers of patients
ready and willing to do just such
work, seems to me like the sorriest sort
of jest. Yet “The Catch of the Season”
and “Lady Madcap” have their good
points.</p>

<p>What is possibly the best song in
London this season occurs in “Lady
Madcap.” It is sung by Maurice Farkoa,
and is called “I Love You in Velvet.”
It has pretty music, clever words
and much “catchiness,” and it is so admirably
and artistically sung that it redeemed
the musical comedy itself, and
made it quite endurable.</p>

<p>The star of the performance is J.&nbsp;P.
Huntley, a prime London favorite and
one who has been very well received in
New York. Huntley, like a good many
other comedians, is far more useful for
flavoring purposes than for a steady
diet. There was such a dose of him in
“Lady Madcap” that he grew to be a
terrible bore. This young actor is to
leave the George Edwardes forces and
go to the Shubert Brothers, and I
can’t help wondering which of the two
parties will get tired first. I have my
own ideas on the subject, but perhaps
it would be advisable not to express
them.</p>

<p>So barren is this London season that
I have not been able to formulate my
plan of dealing with it&mdash;you may have
guessed as much! There is nothing to
wax enthusiastic over, and no one performance
that remains, luminous, in the
mind. At the New Theater&mdash;and isn’t
that an absurd title for a playhouse,
that, with its actors and audiences, is
aging daily?&mdash;they are playing “Leah
Kleschna,” which Mr. Frohman advertises
in the New York manner by a
catchline from Mr. Walkley’s criticism
in the London <i>Times</i>: “It hits you
bang in the eye”&mdash;or something equally
pretty and graphic. I am not at all
sure that it does anything of the sort.
It is not looked upon as an epoch-maker,
and it lacks the charm of oddity
and mystery that was given to it in
New York by Mrs. Fiske herself.</p>

<p>We all thought when we saw “Leah
Kleschna” at the Manhattan Theater
that Mrs. Fiske played a non-star part,
and subordinated herself to the others.
Let me tell you, however, most emphatically,
after having seen “Leah
Kleschna” twice in New York and once
in London, that Mrs. Fiske herself is
its mainstay. She is absolutely its very
backbone. Without her, at the New
Theater, the piece is but a gloomy melodrama,
and as such it is received by
the London public. Be quite sure of
that. Of course the play itself <i>is</i> cheap,
but it masquerades somewhat successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
under the guise of a study in
criminology&mdash;and all that sort of thing.
In New York Mrs. Fiske, by her eccentricities,
and various little intellectualities
that you recall when you see Miss
Lena Ashwell’s tame and bloodless performance
in London, helped the illusion.
She never quite allowed you to
believe that “Leah Kleschna” was outside
of her own répertoire of peculiarities.</p>

<p>The play is extremely well acted in
London by everybody but Miss Ashwell.
She is a weak imitation of Mrs. Fiske’s
many bad points&mdash;notably her indistinctness
of diction. Probably Miss
Ashwell never saw Mrs. Fiske in all her
life, but Mr. Dion Boucicault, who
staged the play in London, must have
watched Mrs. Fiske attentively, and
have given Miss Ashwell full particulars.
At times it was quite ludicrous to
listen to the English actress positively
affecting the American actress’ most
lamentable demerit. She bit up her
words, emitted the fragments in a frenzied
torrent, sank her voice at critical
moments, and did all that Mrs. Fiske
has been implored <i>not</i> to do.</p>

<p>Charles Warner, who played the
father, threw himself successfully at the
part, but forced us to recall his long
continuous service in “Drink.” Occasionally
<i>Kleschna</i> seemed to have
“jim-jams,” and one could not dissociate
Mr. Warner from his well-known,
world-played performance. Herbert
Waring played <i>Raoul</i> extremely well,
but the <i>Schram</i> of William Devereaux
is not to be compared with the capital
interpretation given to the part by William
B. Mack in New York. All that
Mr. Frohman could do for “Leah
Kleschna” he did, but the piece needed
Mrs. Fiske. Without her it is of little
importance&mdash;a sort of old Adelphi play
in kid gloves.</p>

<p>A piece that seems to have eluded the
“American invasion” is “Mr. Hopkinson,”
which has been running for
months at Wyndham’s Theater. It is
the work of Mr. R.&nbsp;C. Carton, who was
responsible, as you may remember, for
“The Rich Mrs. Repton,” which ran for
three nights or so in New York last season.
Perhaps the “American invasion”
remembered that, for if nothing succeeds
like success, certainly nothing
fails like failure.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hopkinson,” however, would
scarcely be possible for American consumption.
Its hero is a cockney cad,
who would hardly be intelligible in New
York. New York has its own brand of
cad&mdash;a highly accentuated kind&mdash;and
should not be blamed for shirking the
notion of fathoming the motives of the
English style of blackguard. Then the
part of <i>Hopkinson</i> is played by Mr.
James Welch, for whom it might have
been built. I can imagine no other actor
playing it, with the possible exception
of Francis Wilson. The piece has
simply hung onto the coat tails of little
Mr. James Welch.</p>

<p>It is a farce filled with nasty types&mdash;all
titled, of course. People who nauseate,
if taken seriously, are used as the
excuse for various farcical situations.
<i>Hopkinson</i> himself, who is a rich
“bounder,” becomes engaged to a pretty
society girl, and on the eve of the wedding
she elopes. The “hero” then marries
a woman whom he has jilted, and
who, in her turn, has blackmailed him.
Nearly all the characters in the piece
are of the decadent order. They are
the sort that occur seriously in “The
Walls of Jericho,” at the Garrick Theater.
They are, perhaps, better there, but
quite unnecessary anywhere, and even
improper.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hopkinson” has puzzled a good
many people who saw it. They have
wondered why it ran so long, and what
there was in the piece that held it up,
so to speak. Its success was simply
due to James Welch, a quaint, freakish
little actor&mdash;a sort of Louie Freear in
trousers. Many plays of the same slight
artistic value have succeeded because
one actor has seemed to give a new
wrinkle in comedy to the public. “Mr.
Hopkinson” without James Welch
would be a singularly risky proposition&mdash;worse
than “Leah Kleschna” without
Mrs. Fiske. Evidently the “American
invasion” agreed with me&mdash;which
makes it pleasant for me, don’t you
think?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE public has passed
a few pleasant summer
hours in discussing,
through the medium
of various journals,
what people like
to read. Very interesting
information comes
to light regarding the sort of fiction
preferred by different personalities, female
chiefly, in days past and present.
There seems to be no difficulty in getting
hold of facts; indeed, it becomes
apparently a sort of mania with some
successful people to explain their own
results by hunting up their early literary
likes and dislikes. Perhaps stories
have molded some of us more or
less&mdash;in all conscience let us hope so&mdash;since
we wander in such a wilderness
of them.</p>

<p>But, really, the serious thing to be
considered just now is not so much
what we like to read as what we have
to, if we want to be amused. For that
which we write depends upon that
which we are, of course, and we
reap in fiction what we sow in society.
Therefore, being rather commercial,
rather frivolous and rather in search of
new sensations, we get all our business,
and small talk, and scandal back again,
faithfully reproduced, from the book
sellers’ counters, and must go all over it
once more with as good a grace as may
be.</p>

<p>If taste and idealism are to prevail
over hard facts, somebody must see
pretty strenuously to it, ere long. In
the meantime we may as well settle
down to a thoroughly American literary
atmosphere, relieved here and there by
bits of nebulous romancing which pass
for idealistic production. We really
don’t object. We love ourselves too
well to want company. Anthony Trolloppe,
and Miss Yonge, and Mrs. Oliphant,
William Black and Thomas
Hardy could introduce us to scores of
pleasant English people, but their
heroes and heroines belong to a different
world altogether, and are laid on the
shelf nowadays, probably never to be
taken up by the mass of readers except
as refreshing antiquities when American
repetition finally palls on us. The
best we can do for an occasional let-up
is to hunt up odd people or places, now
and then, and write them up. Let us
hope the supply will remain inexhaustible,
and that the batch of novels for
this season may give us a view of life
outside of prescribed limits.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>“The Orchid,” by Robert Grant,
Scribner’s, might be an authentic biography
of a twentieth-century society
woman, including a faithful delineation
of her environment. It is not, strictly
speaking, a study of character or society,
but rather a photographic reproduction
of people and conditions. In
this fact is to be found the book’s only
defect as a literary work. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
weighing of motives or analysis of
character; nothing but a plain recital
of facts as they are found to exist.</p>

<p>Lydia Arnold, who marries for
money, is divorced, and remarries for
love, is cold-blooded and unscrupulous
as many a social queen in real life; and
her device for securing the means to
support her position as the wife of her
lover, revolting as it is to sensitive people,
is not entirely unprecedented. It
may be that the type to which she belongs
is an extreme one, but the fact
that she shocked her friends and associates
indicates that they had not entirely
outgrown their natural impulses
rather than that her enormities are absolutely
unknown.</p>

<p>We can understand the pessimism of
Mrs. Andrew Cunningham when she
exclaimed: “The only unpardonable
sin in this country is to lose one’s
money. Nothing else counts,” but the
facts thus far do not justify it; there
are some former leaders of society who
may be supposed to wish that the generalization
were true. They have not
found it so.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>“Wall Street” has a significance, not
merely as the name of a famous thoroughfare,
but as epitomizing the forces
which produce the profoundest effects
upon the industrial and even political
and social life of America. It is not at
all surprising, therefore, that the activities
which it represents should be resorted
to for a supply of material for
interesting stories.</p>

<p>The latest fiction on this subject is
Edwin Lefevre’s book, “The Golden
Flood,” published by McClure, Phillips
&amp; Co. The author, who has to his credit
quite a list of short Wall Street stories,
is thoroughly familiar with his
ground, and possesses, besides, a genuine
gift of story-telling. “The Golden
Flood” may possibly be criticised as
dealing with a somewhat impossible
theme&mdash;an attempt to corner the gold
supply; but the description of the manner
in which it affects “the richest man
in the world” is so absorbingly interesting
that probabilities are forgotten.
The mixture of innocence and guile in
young Mr. Grinnell, assumed for the
purpose of mystifying Mellen and Dawson,
is a good bit of character drawing.
But, though these men in the story were
worked up to the point of believing that
Grinnell practised alchemy, it is doubtful
if their prototypes in real life could
be so affected. The explanation, however,
turns out to be a practical one, and
it is so timed as to sustain the interest
to the end.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>Unquestionably the best short stories
of American politics so far published
are those by Elliott Flower in a volume
entitled “Slaves of Success,” L.&nbsp;C. Page
&amp; Co. There are eight of them, a connected
series in which John Wade and
Ben Carroll are the chief actors.</p>

<p>Wade and Carroll represent two types
of the political boss. The former is
described as “politically unscrupulous,
but personally honest”&mdash;a combination
sometimes found; “Carroll, on the other
hand, used politics for his pecuniary
advantage;” he worked for his pocket
all the time.</p>

<p>The two men personally had little
love for each other, but as each controlled
a part of the political machine,
they were obliged to work together in
order to produce results. Their methods
of manipulating the machine, however,
were not essentially different; if
Wade had scruples about offering a man
money, yet he would, for a political
advantage, let him steal from others or
from the State; and his willingness to
practise blackmail to compass his own
election to the Senate was what finally
put an end to his career.</p>

<p>Carroll was disposed of at last also,
but his downfall was due to a grossly
covetous disposition.</p>

<p>The stories give a very convincing
series of pictures of municipal and State
politics; the incidents are all of them
more or less familiar, but they are all
of them extremely interesting, and the
narrative is considerably enlivened by
the introduction into it of a rather original
character for a State legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Azro Craig, a man who is not only
scrupulously honest, but has not the
slightest hesitation in voting and speaking
as he thinks.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>A somewhat striking story, though
one which, it is to be feared, is unlikely
to attain a very wide popularity, is
Evelyn Underhill’s “The Gray World,”
Century Company. It is, to all intents
and purposes, a study in spiritual development,
the experiences of a soul in
search of the beautiful, and disguised&mdash;unconsciously,
of course&mdash;in minor
respects, it is substantially indentical
with Hawthorne’s “Artist of the Beautiful.”</p>

<p>There is in both the consciousness,
vague at first, of a spiritual end to be
achieved, and the struggle toward it,
the depression and hopeless sense of
defeat after each encounter with the
material, and finally the successful climax
of endeavor which sees, with a
cheerful appreciation of true values, the
obliteration of the physical means by
which it has been reached. The spirit
of the slum child after its plunge into
the gray world, and its reincarnation in
Willie Hopkinson, traveled the same
road as that trod by Owen Warland.
Both had to undergo this same pitying
contempt on the part of their sensible
friends and acquaintances, by
whom they were mourned as men of
promise who wasted their opportunities.</p>

<p>But if Owen Warland was isolated
from human companionship, Willie
Hopkinson had at least one comprehending
friend in Hester Waring, who
helped toward his final enlightenment.
“She knew very well that he was one
of her company; made for quiet journeyings,
not for that frenzied rush to
catch a hypothetical train, which is
called the strenuous life.”</p>

<p>Because the company is so small, the
story will probably be understood and
enjoyed by but few; and that it is made
the means of teaching a lesson, hard to
learn, will be another reason for its lack
of popularity. Nevertheless, it is a book
that ought to be read.</p>

<p>What is essentially characteristic of
George Barr McCutcheon’s stories, is
his disregard of conventional methods
in his selection of material for his plots.
This is true of his Graustark stories&mdash;though
some captious critics profess to
see in them a similarity to Anthony
Hope’s work&mdash;and the same quality is
found in “The Day of the Dog.”</p>

<p>His latest book is “The Purple Parasol,”
Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., and it furnishes
the same sort of more or less
fantastic entertainment that distinguishes
the author’s other stories. Few
people, we imagine, would be likely to
select, a purple parasol as a clew by
means of which to track an eloping
wife; it seems a little incongruous that
a woman, in arranging an elopement,
should include such an article among
her effects. A purple parasol is not a
necessity on such a trip, and, besides,
it is apt to be conspicuous.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wharton did take one, and,
as luck would have it, Helen Dering
also had one; therefore it is not to be
wondered at that Sam Rossiter made
the mistake that he did. Though his
blunder was the cause of considerable
unhappiness to him and some humiliation
for Miss Dering, the explanations,
when they came, were of the most satisfying
kind.</p>

<p>The book is handsomely illustrated
in colors by Harrison Fisher, and decorated
by Charles B. Falls.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>Alaska is a region of which much
has been written in the last six or eight
years, since the opening of the Klondike,
but the literature on the subject,
having been confined mostly to newspaper
accounts of gold discoveries and the
stories of Mr. Jack London and Mr.
Rex E. Beach, has not been such as to
impart a very wide variety of information
upon important points.</p>

<p>A book which the publishers announce
as the first “to deal in any adequate
way with our great Arctic possession,”
is John S. McLain’s “Alaska and
the Klondike,” McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.
Mr. McLain accompanied the sub-committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of the Senate Committee on Territories
on their visit to Alaska in 1903,
and, of course, had unusual opportunities
to gather interesting facts.</p>

<p>The trip was a comprehensive one,
and the result, now embodied in this
book, shows that its author lost no
chances to observe and record important
and more or less unfamiliar matters
that will entertain as well as instruct his
readers.</p>

<p>The book is written in a natural, unpretentious,
flowing style, and the material
is skillfully handled so as to concentrate
the attention and stimulate the
imagination. Besides this, there are a
great many half-tone reproductions of
photographs, which help to make the
narrative more graphic.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>“Miss Bellard’s Inspiration,” Harper’s,
is William D. Howells’ latest
story. It is one which, if it could be
subjected to the right kind of adaptation,
would make a successful and refreshing
little comedy. For, in spite of
the shadow which Mrs. Mevison casts
over the tale, the very human qualities
of Mr. and Mrs. Crombie and the self-communings
of Miss Bellard, the results
of which neutralize the British directness
of Edmund Craybourne, make a delicious
combination with Mr. Howells’
good-natured cynicism, which, indeed,
is so good-natured as to be humor
rather that cynicism.</p>

<p>The story is rather a slight one, too
slight, in fact, to be called a novel; it is
one which can be read in the course of a
couple of hours and with fully sustained
interest to the end, when Miss Bellard
explains and acts upon her inspiration.
She supplies all the novelty in the story;
she is by no means a commonplace character.
Her manner of falling in love,
her reasons for breaking her engagement
with Craybourne, and the inspiration
which led to its reinstatement are
not what might be expected by the veteran
novel reader. But she is vindicated
in the end by the fact that she is
a woman, and a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crombie plays her part with a
good deal of sprightliness and adds not
a little to the humor of the story. Her
rather fierce rebellion at the idea of being
imposed upon by her niece and her
subsequent abject surrender are all very
funny, the more so because she has no
idea of being funny.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>It seems a long time&mdash;possibly it isn’t
really&mdash;- since a story of adventure, so
thoroughly good as “Terence O’Rourke,
Gentleman Adventurer,” has appeared.
It is written by Louis Joseph Vance and
published by A. Wessells Company.</p>

<p>It is, of course, crammed full of action,
one episode following the other
in quick succession without tiresome descriptions
or unnecessarily prolonged introductions;
episodes that are fresh,
vivid and full of color as different as
possible from the hackneyed type that
has been familiar for years. But the
love interest has not been neglected. It
is a very pretty story of the loyalty of
the light-hearted Irishman, the thread
of which runs through the whole book,
its climax being reserved as the hero’s
reward at the end.</p>

<p>As the central figure in the series of
adventures described is O’Rourke, so
the most conspicuously meritorious
piece of literary work is the delineation
of his character. It cannot, of course,
be called a character study, inasmuch as
the author’s obvious intention in writing
the tale, was to create complications for
his hero to overcome rather than to
solve questions of psychology. But he
has, nevertheless, presented in the person
of “the O’Rourke of Castle
O’Rourke,” a clean, generous, whole-souled
Irish gentleman, one of a type
that is always lovable.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>The title of William J. Locke’s novel,
“The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne,” John
Lane, is somewhat misleading, for there
is nothing in the book to show that the
character of Sir Marcus could be made
the subject of serious criticism. His
aunt’s grim disapproval and ready suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of him may fairly be attributed
to causes quite foreign to the question
of his thorough respectability. It may
be, however, that the reference in the
title is, not to his personal morals, but
to his “History of Renaissance Morals,”
upon which he was engaged.</p>

<p>He was considered by his superiors
steady enough to be a good schoolmaster,
and his accession to the family title
does not seem to have marked any material
change in his personal habits, although
the sudden appearance of Carlotta
was a disturbing influence in his
life, as it might be in that of the most
sedate among us. Carlotta’s introduction
is somewhat unusual, if not improbable,
but it is to be remembered that a
bright, attractive English girl, most of
whose life has been spent in a Turkish
harem, cannot be expected to conform,
all at once, to English standards of conventionality.</p>

<p>Ordeyne’s tribulations, growing out
of his enforced guardianship of this extraordinary
young woman, may be
easily understood, but will hardly be
considered a reason for condoling or
sympathizing with him.</p>

<p>The end of his “extravagant adventure”
is obvious enough. It is, in fact,
the only logical conclusion under the
circumstances. Naturally Judith and
Aunt Jessica disapproved, though for
widely different reasons.</p>

<div class="p15 b1 figcenter" style="width: 111px;"><img src="images/itb.png" width="111" height="26" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith has done us
all a service in his volume of short
stories to which he has given the name
“At Close Range,” published by Scribner’s.
One of the principal charms of
these stories lies in the unpretentiousness
of them; they are modest little
tales about modest people; people who
sometimes seem to have little tenderness
or generosity about them, but who, after
all, confirm the author’s theory “that
at the bottom of every heart crucible
choked with life’s cinders there can almost
always be found a drop of gold.”</p>

<p>Each one of the stories has just the
one touch of nature that always makes
its appeal irresistible. Steve Dodd,
Sam Makin, Jack Stirling and Captain
Shortrode are common enough characters,
and of a type from which not much
is usually looked for except the energetic
pursuit of business, but under the
proper stimulus they show traits and
impulses similar to those of the Dear
Old Lady.</p>
